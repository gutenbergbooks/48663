<h2>INTRODUCTORY</h2>


<p>Thirty million soldiers, each living a great human
story&mdash;this is the real drama of the Great War as it is
being written into the hearts and memories of the men
at the front. If these soldiers could be gathered around
one camp-fire, and each soldier could relate the most
thrilling moment of his experience&mdash;what stories we
would hear! "Don Quixote," the "Arabian Nights,"
Dante's "Inferno," Milton's "Paradise Lost, and Regained"&mdash;all
the legends and tales of the world's literature
out-told by the soldiers themselves.</p>

<p>It is from the lips of these soldiers, and those who
have passed through the tragedy of the war&mdash;the women
and children whose eyes have beheld the inferno and
whose souls have been uplifted by suffering and self-sacrifice&mdash;the
generations will hear the epic of the days
when millions of men gave their lives to "make the world
safe for Democracy." The magnitude of this gigantic
struggle against autocracy is such that human imagination
cannot visualize it&mdash;it requires one to stand face to
face with death itself.</p>

<p>A member of the British War Staff estimates that
more than a million letters a day are passing from the
trenches and bases of the various armies "to the folk
back home." Another observer at the General Headquarters
of one of the armies estimates that more than
a million and a half diaries are being kept by the soldiers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
It is in these words, inscribed by bleeding bodies and
suffering hearts, that posterity is to hear <i>True Stories of
the Great War</i>.</p>

<p>It is the purpose of these volumes, therefore, to begin
the preservation of these soldiers' stories. This is the
first collection that has been made; it is in itself an historic
event. The manner in which this service has been
performed may be of interest to the reader. It was my
privilege to appoint a committee, or board of editors, to
collect stories from soldiers in the various armies&mdash;personal
letters, records of personal experiences, reminiscences,
and all other available material. An exhaustive
investigation has been made into the files of European
and American periodicals to find the various narratives
that have "crept into print."</p>

<p>More than eight thousand stories were considered. The
vast amount of human material would require innumerable
volumes to preserve it. It was the judgment of the
committee that this documentary evidence could be
brought into practical limitations by selecting a sufficient
number of narratives to cover every human phase of the
Great War and preserve them in six volumes.</p>

<p>This first collection of "True Stories" forms what
might be termed a "story-history" of the Great War, although
all chronological plan is purposely avoided in
order to preserve the story-teller's "reality" rather than
the historian's record.</p>

<p>These volumes are in the nature of a "Round Table"
in which soldiers, refugees, nurses, eye-witnesses&mdash;all
gather about the pages and relate the most thrilling episodes
of their war experiences. We hear the tales of the
soldiers who invaded Belgium, through the campaigns
and battles on all the fronts, to the landing of the American
troops in France. Diplomats tell of the scenes at
the outbreak of the war; despatch bearers relate their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
missions of danger from Paris to Berlin, London, Vienna,
Petrograd; refugees describe the flight of the Belgians,
the exodus of the Serbians, the invasion of Poland. Emissaries
at General Headquarters tell of their dinners with
the Kaiser and the Crown Prince, with Hindenburg and
Zimmerman, and describe the scenes inside the German
empire. Soldiers from the Marne, the Aisne, Verdun&mdash;relate
their experiences. We listen to passengers tossed
into the sea from the <i>Lusitania</i>; revolutionists who overthrew
the Czar in Russia; exiles returning from Siberia.
We hear the tales of the fighters from South Africa,
Egypt, Turkey; stories from the Far East along the seas
of China. The lieutenant of the <i>Emden</i> relates his adventures.
There are stories told by Kitchener's "mob";
the "fighting Irish," Scottish Highlanders, the Canadians,
the Australians, the Hindus. The French hussars and
poilus tell of their experiences; the Italians in the Alps,
the Austrians in the Carpathians&mdash;the stories cover the
whole world and every race and nation.</p>

<p>These personal narratives reveal the psychology of war
in all its horrible reality&mdash;modern warfare on its gigantic
scale&mdash;the genius of invention and organization applied
to destruction. They reveal, moreover, the psychology of
human nature and human emotions in all their moods
and passions. The first impression is of the physical horror
of the war, but this is soon overcome by the higher
spirituality that impels men to sacrifice their lives for
civilization and humanity. The stories sink at times into
grossest brutality only to rise to the heights of nobility
on the part of the sufferers. Officers tell of the charges
of their battalions; the men in the trenches tell of the
"nights of terror"; spies tell of their secret missions;
nurses deliver the death-messages of the dying; priests
tell how they carry the Cross of Christ to the bloody
fields; the prisoners tell the "inside story of the prisons";<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
aviators relate their death-duels in the air; submarine
officers tell how they torpedo and capture the enemies'
ships. There is testimony from the lips of women who
were ravaged; children who were brutally mutilated; witnesses
who saw soldiers crucified; soldiers lashed to their
guns; babies torn from their mothers' arms; homes in
flames and ruins, cathedrals desecrated.</p>

<p>And yet there is an undercurrent of humanity in these
human documents. In their physical aspect they are
almost beyond human belief&mdash;but there is a certain spiritual
force running through them. There is a nobility in
them that rises above all the physical anguish.</p>

<p>These stories (and this war) reveal the souls of men
as has nothing before in modern times. The war has
taught men "how to die." These men have lost all fear
of death. They have traveled the road of the crucifixion
and stood before Calvary; they have caught a
glimpse of something finer, nobler, truer than their own
individual existence. Through suffering and self-sacrifice
they have risen to the noblest heights. They have
found something that we who have not faced death in
the trenches may never find&mdash;they have felt an exaltation
in mind and body that we may never know. There is
the fire of the Old Crusaders about them; they have
caught the realization of the glory of humanity as they
march into the face of death. It is interesting to observe
that wherever the story-teller is fighting for a principle,
he sees no horror in war or death. It is only where he
thinks of his individual suffering, where his thoughts are
of his own physical self, that he complains.</p>

<p>And there is even humor in these stories; we see men
laughing at death; we see the wounded smiling and telling
humorous tales of their suffering; there is irony,
cajolery, good-natured satire, and loud outbursts of
laughter. And there is tenderness in them&mdash;kindness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
gentleness, devotion, affection, and love. We find in
them every human passion&mdash;and every divine emotion.
They form a new insight into character and manhood&mdash;they
inspire us with a new and deeper faith in humanity.</p>

<p>The committee in making these selections found that
many of the human documents of the Great War are
being preserved by the British, French, and German publishing
houses, but it is the American publishers who are
performing the greatest service in the preservation of war
literature. We have given consideration wherever possible
to the notable work that is being done by our
American colleagues. While we have selected from all
sources what we consider to be <i>the best stories of the
war</i>, giving full recognition in every instance to the original
sources, it is a pleasure to state that our American
periodicals have been given the preference. They cordially
co-operated with us in this undertaking and we
trust the public will show their due appreciation. We
would especially call attention to the list of books and
publishers recorded in the contents pages of the several
volumes; also to the periodicals which are preserving
many of the human stories of the war. These will form
the basis for much of the literature of the future.</p>

<p>As editor-in-chief of these volumes, I desire further
to give full recognition to my associates: Mr. M. M.
Lourens, of the University of Leyden; Mr. Egbert Gilliss
Handy, founder of The Search-Light Library; Mr.
Walter R. Bickford, former managing editor of The
Journal of American History; and the staff of investigators
at The Search-Light Library who made the
extensive researches and comprehensive bibliographies&mdash;covering
the whole range of literature on The Great
War&mdash;required as a basis for the production of these
books.</p>

<h2>STORIES OF THE THREE MEN WHO
CAUSED THE WORLD WAR</h2>

<div class="center">
"<i>How I Met the Kaiser, Crown Prince and
Archduke</i>"<br /><br />
<i>Told by Hall Caine, Famous British Novelist, Who
Offered All to His Country</i><br />
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>This celebrated novelist, since the outbreak of the War, has
fought a noble battle for the Anglo-Saxon race with the "pen
that is mightier than the sword." His appeals to America have
been the voice of a world patriot calling in the name of humanity.
He presents the great actors in vivid pen pictures, the
Kaiser, the Crown Prince, the Archduke. The following pen
sketches are from "The Drama of 365 Days," by permission of

I&mdash;PEN PORTRAITS OF THE KAISER</h3>

<p>Other whisperings there were of the storm that was
so soon to burst on the world. In the ominous silence
there were rumours of a certain change that was coming
over the spirit of the Kaiser. For long years he had
been credited with a sincere love of peace, and a ceaseless
desire to restrain the forces about him that were making
for war. Although constantly occupied with the making
of a big army, and inspiring it with great ideals, he was
thought to have as little desire for actual warfare as his
ancestor, Frederick William, had shown, while gathering
up his giant guardsmen and refusing to allow them to
fight. Particularly it was believed in Berlin (not altogether
graciously) that his affection for, and even fear
of his grandmother, Queen Victoria, would compel him
to exhaust all efforts to preserve peace in the event of
trouble with Great Britain. But Victoria was dead, and
King Edward might perhaps be smiled at&mdash;behind his
back&mdash;and then a younger generation was knocking at
the Kaiser's door in the person of his eldest son, who
represented forces which he might not long be able to
hold in check. How would he act now?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>Thousands of persons in this country had countless
opportunities before the war of forming an estimate of
the Kaiser's character. I had only one, and it was not of
the best. For years the English traveller abroad felt as
if he were always following in the track of a grandiose
personality who was playing on the scene of the world
as on a stage, fond as an actor of dressing up in fine
uniforms, of making pictures, scenes, and impressions,
and leaving his visible mark behind him&mdash;as in the case
of the huge gap in the thick walls of Jerusalem, torn
down (it was said with his consent) to let his equipage
pass through.</p>

<p>In Rome I saw a man who was a true son of his
ancestors. Never had the laws of heredity better justified
themselves. Frederick William, Frederick the
Great, William the First&mdash;the Hohenzollerns were all
there. The glittering eyes, the withered arm, the features
that gave signs of frightful periodical pain, the immense
energy, the gigantic egotism, the ravenous vanity, the
fanaticism amounting to frenzy, the dominating power,
the dictatorial temper, the indifference to suffering
(whether his own or other people's), the overbearing
suppression of opposing opinions, the determination to
control everybody's interest, everybody's work&mdash;I thought
all this was written in the Kaiser's masterful face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came stories. One of my friends in Rome was
an American doctor who had been called to attend a lady
of the Emperor's household. "Well, doctor, what's she
suffering from?" said the Kaiser. The doctor told him.
"Nothing of the kind&mdash;you're entirely wrong. She's
suffering from so and so," said the Majesty of Germany,
stamping up and down the room. At length the American
doctor lost control. "Sir," he said, "in my country
we have a saying that one bad practitioner is worth
twenty good amateurs&mdash;you're the amateur." The doctor
lived through it. Frederick William would have dragged
him to the window and tried to fling him out of it.
William II put his arm round the doctor's shoulder and
said, "I didn't mean to hurt you, old fellow. Let us sit
down and talk."</p>

<p>A soldier came with another story. After a sham
fight conducted by the Kaiser the generals of the German
army had been summoned to say what they thought
of the Royal man&oelig;uvers. All had formed an unfavourable
opinion, yet one after another, with some insincere
compliment, had wriggled out of the difficulty of candid
criticism. But at length came an officer, who said:</p>

<p>"Sir, if it had been real warfare to-day there wouldn't
be enough wood in Germany to make coffins for the men
who would be dead."</p>

<p>The general lived through it, too&mdash;at first in a certain
disfavour, but afterwards in recovered honour.</p>

<p>Such was the Kaiser, who a year ago had to meet the
mighty wind of War. He was in Norway for his usual
summer holiday in July, 1914, when affairs were reaching
their crisis. Rumour has it that he was not satisfied
with the measure of the information that was reaching
him, therefore he returned to Berlin, somewhat to the
discomfiture of his ministers, intending, it is said, for
various reasons (not necessarily humanitarian) to stop or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
at least postpone the war. If so, he arrived too late. He
was told that matters had gone too far. They must go
on now. "Very well, if they must, they must," he is reported
to have said. And there is the familiar story that
after he had signed his name on the first of August to
the document that plunged Europe into the conflict that
has since shaken it to its foundations, he flung down his
pen and cried, "You'll live to regret this, gentlemen."</p>


<h3>II&mdash;PEN-PORTRAIT OF THE CROWN PRINCE</h3>

<p>And then the Crown Prince. In August of last year
nine out of every ten of us would have said that not the
father, but the son, of the Royal family of Germany
had been the chief provocative cause of the war. Subsequent
events have lessened the weight of that opinion.
But the young man's known popularity among an active
section of the officers of the army; their subterranean
schemes to set him off against his father; a vague suspicion
of the Kaiser's jealousy of his eldest son&mdash;all these
facts and shadows of facts give colour to the impression
that not least among the forces which led the Emperor
on that fateful first of August to declare war against
Russia was the presence and the importunity of the
Crown Prince. What kind of man was it, then, whom
the invisible powers of evil were employing to precipitate
this insensate struggle?</p>

<p>Hundreds of persons in England, France, Russia and
Italy must have met the Crown Prince of Germany at
more or less close quarters, and formed their own estimates
of his character. The barbed-wire fence of protective
ceremony which usually surrounds Royal personages,
concealing their little human foibles, was periodically
broken down in the case of the Heir-Apparent to
the German Throne by his incursion every winter into a
small cosmopolitan community which repaired to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
snows of the Engadine for health or pleasure. In that
stark environment I myself, in common with many others,
saw the descendant of the Fredericks every day, for
several weeks of several years, at a distance that called
for no intellectual field-glasses. And now I venture to
say, for whatever it may be worth, that the result was
an entirely unfavourable impression.</p>

<p>I saw a young man without a particle of natural distinction,
whether physical, moral, or mental. The figure,
long rather than tall; the hatchet face, the selfish eyes,
the meaningless mouth, the retreating forehead, the vanishing
chin, the energy that expressed itself merely in
restless movement, achieving little, and often aiming at
nothing at all; the uncultivated intellect, the narrow
views of life and the world; the morbid craving for
change, for excitement of any sort; the indifference to
other people's feelings, the shockingly bad manners, the
assumption of a right to disregard and even to outrage
the common conventions on which social intercourse depends&mdash;all
this was, so far as my observation enabled
me to judge, only too plainly apparent in the person of
the Crown Prince.</p>

<p>Outside the narrow group that gathered about him
(a group hailing, ironically enough, from the land of a
great Republic) I cannot remember to have heard in any
winter one really warm word about him, one story of an
act of kindness, or even generous condescension, such as
it is easy for a royal personage to perform. On the
contrary, I was constantly hearing tales of silly fooleries,
of overbearing behaviour, of deliberate rudeness, such as
irresistibly recalled, in spirit if not in form, the conduct
of the common barrator in the guise of a king, who, if
Macaulay's stories are to be credited, used to kick a lady
in the open streets and tell her to go home and mind
her brats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<h3>III&mdash;PEN-PORTRAIT OF THE ARCHDUKE
FERDINAND
</h3>

<p>Then the Archduke Ferdinand of Austro-Hungary,
whose assassination was the ostensible cause of this
devastating war&mdash;what kind of man was he? Quite a
different person from the Crown Prince, and yet, so
far as I could judge, just as little worthy of the appalling
sacrifice of human life which his death has occasioned.</p>

<p>Not long before his tragic end I spent a month under
the same roof with him, and though the house was only
an hotel, it was situated in a remote place, and though
I was not in any sense of the Archduke's party, I walked
and talked frequently with most of the members of it,
and so, with the added help of daily observation, came
to certain conclusions about the character of the principal
personage.</p>

<p>A middle-aged man, stiff-set, heavy-jawed, with a
strong step, and a short manner; obviously proud, reserved,
silent, slightly imperious, self-centred, self-opinionated,
well-educated in the kind of knowledge all such
men must possess, but narrow in intellect, retrograde in
sympathy, a stickler for social conventions, an almost
unyielding upholder of royal rights, prerogatives, customs,
and usages (although by his own marriage he had
violated one of the first of the laws of his class, and by
his unfailing fidelity to his wife continued to resist it),
superstitious rather than religious, an immense admirer of
the Kaiser, and a decidedly hostile critic of our own
country&mdash;such was the general impression made on one
British observer by the Archduke Ferdinand.</p>

<p>The man is dead; he took no part in the war, except
unwittingly by the act of dying, and therefore one could
wish to speak of him with respect and restraint. Otherwise
it might be possible to justify this estimate of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
character by the narration of little incidents, and one
such, though trivial in itself, may perhaps bear description.
The younger guests of the hotel in the mountains
had got up a fancy dress ball, and among persons clad
in all conceivable costumes, including those of monks,
cardinals, and even popes, a lady of demure manners,
who did not dance, had come downstairs in the habit of a
nun. This aroused the superstitious indignation of the
Archduke, who demanded that the lady should retire from
the room instantly, or he would order his carriage and
leave the hotel at once.</p>

<p>Of course, the inevitable happened&mdash;the Archduke's
will became law, and the lady went upstairs in tears,
while I and two or three others (Catholics among us)
thought and said, "Heaven help Europe when the time
comes for its destinies to depend largely on the judgment
of a man whose bemuddled intellect cannot distinguish
between morality of the real world and of an
entirely fantastic and fictitious one."</p>

<p>(Hall Caine in his pen portraits from the War describes
"A Conversation with Lord Roberts"; "The Motherhood
of France"; "The Russian Soul"; "The Soul of Poland";
"The Part Played by Italy," and sixty-two dramatic
sketches.)</p>

<h2>MY VISIT TO KING ALBERT&mdash;THE
KING WHOSE THRONE IS THE
HEARTS OF HIS PEOPLE</h2>

<div class="center">"<i>I Am Bound on a Mission from the President
of France</i>"<br /><br />
<i>Told by Pierre Loti, of the French Academy, and
Captain in the French Navy</i>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>This master of the modern school of French letters offered his
services to his Country at the outbreak of the War. As Captain
Julien Viaud, of the Naval Reserve, this famous author
was assigned to the dockyards. He longed for more active
service and appealed to the Minister of Marine: "I should
accept with joy, with pride, any position whatsoever that would
bring me nearer to the fighting line, even if it were a very subordinate
post, one much below the dignity of my five rows of
gold braid." With his masterful touch Pierre Loti is immortalizing
the War in literature. The story here told of his visit
to King Albert, of Belgium, is from his notable story entitled
"War" in which he describes with simple but touching words
his encounters with wounded soldiers, sisters of mercy and
homeless little Belgian orphans. This one story from his book
of twenty-five inspiring chapters is reproduced by permission of
his publishers, <i>J. B. Lippincott Company</i>: Copyright 1917.</p></blockquote>


<h3>I&mdash;"ON MY WAY TO GENERAL HEADQUARTERS
OF THE BELGIAN ARMY"
</h3>
<p>To-day on my way to the General Headquarters of the
Belgian Army, whither I am bound on a mission from
the President of the French Republic to His Majesty
King Albert, I pass through Furnes, another town wantonly
and savagely bombarded, where at this hour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
day there is a raging storm of icy wind, snow, rain, and
hail, under a black sky.</p>

<p>Here as at Ypres the barbarians bent their whole soul
on the destruction of the historical part, the charming
old town hall and its surroundings. It is here that King
Albert, driven forth from his palace, established himself
at first. Thereupon the Germans, with that delicacy of
feeling to which at present no one in the world disputes
their claim, immediately made this place their objective,
in order to bombard it with their brutal, heavy shells. I
need hardly say that there was scarcely anyone in the
streets, where I slowed down my motor so that I might
have leisure for a better appreciation of the effects of
the Kaiser's "work of civilisation"; there were only some
groups of soldiers, fully armed, some with their coat-collars
turned up, others with the back curtains of their
service-caps turned down. They hastened along in the
squalls, running like children, and laughing good-humouredly,
as if it were very amusing, this downpour, which
for once was not of fire.</p>

<p>How is it that there is no atmosphere of sadness about
this half-empty town? It is as if the gaiety of these
soldiers, in spite of the gloomy weather, had communicated
itself to the ruined surroundings. And how full of
splendid health and spirits they seem! I see no more
on any faces that somewhat startled, haggard expression,
common at the beginning of the war. The outdoor life,
combined with good food, has bronzed the cheeks of
these men whom the shrapnel has spared, but their principal
support and stay is their complete confidence, their
conviction that they have already gained the upper hand
and are marching to victory. The invasion of the
Boches will pass away like this horrible weather, which
after all is only a last shower of March; it will all come
to an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>


<h3>II&mdash;"I CAME UPON A LITTLE KNOT OF
FRENCH SAILORS IN THE STORM"</h3>

<p>At a turning, during a lull in the storm, I come very
unexpectedly upon a little knot of French sailors. I
cannot refrain from beckoning to them, as one would
beckon to children whom one had suddenly found again
in some distant jungle, and they come running to the
door of my car equally delighted to see someone in naval
uniform. They seem to be picked men; they have such
gallant, comely faces and such frank, spirited eyes.
Other sailors, too, who were passing by at a little distance
and whom I had not called, come likewise and
surround me as if it were the natural thing to do, but
with respectful familiarity, for are we not in a strange
country, and at war? Only yesterday, they tell me, they
arrived a whole battalion strong, with their officers, and
they are camping in a neighbouring village while waiting
to "down" the Boches. And I should like so much
to make a <i>détour</i> and pay them a visit in their own camp
if I were not pressed for time, tied down to the hour of
my audience with His Majesty. Indeed it gives me
pleasure to associate with our soldiers, but it is a still
greater delight to associate with our sailors, among whom
I passed forty years of my life. Even before I caught
sight of them, just from hearing them talk, I could recognise
them for what they were. More than once, on our
military thoroughfares in the north, on a pitch-dark night,
when it was one of their detachments who stopped me to
demand the password, I have recognised them simply by
the sound of their voices.</p>

<p>One of our generals, army commander on the Northern
Front, was speaking to me yesterday of that pleasant,
kindly familiarity which prevails from the highest to the
lowest grade of the military ladder, and which is a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
tone characteristic of this essentially national war in
which we all march hand in hand.</p>

<p>"In the trenches," he said to me, "if I stop to talk to
a soldier, other soldiers gather round me so that I may
talk to them too. And they are becoming more and
more admirable for their high spirits and their brotherliness.
If only our thousands of dead could be restored
to us what a benefit this war would have bestowed upon
us, drawing us near together, until we all possess but
one heart."</p>

<p>It is a long way to the General Headquarters. Out
in the open country the weather is appalling beyond
description. The roads are broken up, fields flooded
until they resemble marshes, and sometimes there are
trenches, <i>chevaux de frise</i>, reminding the traveller that
the barbarians are still very near. And yet all this, which
ought to be depressing, no longer succeeds in being so.
Every meeting with soldiers&mdash;and the car passes them
every minute&mdash;is sufficient to restore your serenity.
They have all the same cheerful faces, expressive of
courage and gaiety. Even the poor sappers, up to their
knees in water, working hard to repair the shelter pits and
defences, have an expression of gaiety under their dripping
service-caps. What numbers of soldiers there are
in the smallest villages, Belgian and French, very fraternally
intermingling. By what wonderful organisation of
the commissariat are these men housed and fed?</p>

<p>But who asserted that there were no Belgian soldiers
left? On the contrary, I pass imposing detachments on
their way to the front, in good order, admirably equipped,
and of fine bearing, with a convoy of excellent artillery
of the very latest pattern. Never can enough be said in
praise of the heroism of a people who had every reason
for not preparing themselves for war, since they were
under the protection of solemn treaties that should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
preserved them forever from any such necessity, yet
who, nevertheless, sustained and checked the brunt of
the attack of the great barbarism. Disabled at first and
almost annihilated, yet they are recovering themselves
and gathering around their sublimely heroic king.</p>


<h3>III&mdash;"WE ARRIVE AT LAST&mdash;I SEE THE KING"</h3>

<p>It is raining, raining, and we are numb with cold, but
we have arrived at last, and in another moment I shall
see him, the King, without reproach and without fear.
Were it not for these troops and all these service motor
cars, it would be impossible to believe that this remote
village was the General Headquarters. I have to leave
the car, for the road which leads to the royal residence
is nothing more than a footpath. Among the rough
motor cars standing there, all stained with mud from the
roads, there is one car of superior design, having no
armorial bearings of any kind, nothing but two letters
traced in chalk on the black door, S.M. (<i>Sa Majesté</i>),
for this is <i>his</i> car. In this charming corner of ancient
Flanders, in an old abbey, surrounded by trees and tombs,
here is his dwelling. Out in the rain, on the path which
borders on the little sacred cemetery, an aide-de-camp
comes to meet me, a man with the charm and simplicity
that no doubt likewise characterise his sovereign. There
are no guards at the entrance to the dwelling, and no
ceremony is observed. At the end of an unimposing corridor
where I have just time to remove my overcoat, in
the embrasure of an opening door, the King appears,
erect, tall, slender, with regular features and a surprising
air of youth, with frank eyes, gentle and noble in
expression, stretching out his hand in kindly welcome.</p>

<p>In the course of my life other kings and emperors
have been gracious enough to receive me, but in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
pomp, in spite of the splendour of some of their palaces,
I have never yet felt such reverence for sovereign majesty
as here, on the threshold of this little house, where
it is infinitely exalted by calamity and self-sacrifice; and
when I express this sentiment to King Albert he replies
with a smile, "Oh, as for my palace," and he completes
his phrase with a negligent wave of the hand, indicating
his humble surroundings. It is indeed a simple room
that I have just entered, yet by the mere absence of all
vulgarity, still possessing distinction. A bookcase
crowded with books occupies the whole of one wall; in
the background there is an open piano with a music-book
on the stand; in the middle a large table, covered with
maps and strategic plans; and the window, open in spite
of the cold, looks out on to a little old-world garden,
like that of a parish priest, almost completely enclosed,
stripped of its leaves, melancholy, weeping, as it were,
the rains of winter.</p>

<p>After I have executed the simple mission entrusted to
me by the President of the Republic, the King graciously
detains me a long time in conversation. But if I felt
reluctant to write even the beginning of these notes, still
more do I hesitate to touch upon this interview, even
with the utmost discretion, and then how colourless will
it seem, all that I shall venture to say! It is because
in truth I know that he never ceases to enjoin upon
those around him, "Above all, see that people do not
talk about me," because I know and understand so well
the horror he professes for anything resembling an "interview."
So then at first I made up my mind to be
silent, and yet when there is an opportunity of making
himself heard, who would not long to help to spread
abroad, to the utmost of his small ability, the renown of
such a name?</p>

<p>Very striking in the first place is the sincere and exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
modesty of his heroic nature; it is almost as if
he were unaware that he is worthy of admiration. In
his opinion he has less deserved the veneration which
France has devoted to him, and his popularity among
us, than the least of his soldiers, slain for our common
defence. When I tell him that I have seen even in the
depths of the country, in peasants' cottages, the portraits
of the King and Queen of the Belgians in the place of
honour, with little flags, black, yellow and red, piously
pinned around them, he appears scarcely to believe me;
his smile and his silence seem to answer:</p>

<p>"Yet all that I did was so natural. Could a king
worthy of the name have acted in any other way?"</p>

<p>Now we talk about the Dardanelles, where in this hour
serious issues hang in the balance; he is pleased to question
me about ambushes in those parts, which I frequented
for so long a time, and which have not ceased
to be very dear to me. But suddenly a colder gust blows
in through the window, still opening on to the forlorn
little garden. With what kindly thoughtfulness, then, he
rises, as any ordinary officer might have done, and himself
closes the window near which I am seated.</p>

<p>And then we talk of war, of rifles, of artillery. His
Majesty is well posted in everything, like a general already
broken in to his craft.</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;"A GREAT WARRIOR IN THE MIDST OF
AN ARMY OF HEROES"</h3>

<p>Strange destiny for a prince, who, in the beginning,
did not seem designated for the throne, and who, perhaps,
would have preferred to go on living his former
somewhat retired life by the side of his beloved princess.
Then, when the unlooked-for crown was placed upon
his youthful brow, he might well have believed that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
could hope for an era of profound peace, in the midst of
the most peaceful of all nations, but, contrary to every
expectation, he has known the most appallingly tragic
reign of all. Between one day and the next, without a
moment's weakness, without even a moment's hesitation,
disdainful of compromises, which for a time, at least,
though to the detriment of the civilisation of the world,
might have preserved for a little space his towns and
palaces, he stood erect in the way of the Monster's
onrush, a great warrior king in the midst of an army of
heroes.</p>

<p>To-day it is clear that he has no longer a doubt of
victory, and his own loyalty gives him complete confidence
in the loyalty of the Allies, who truly desire to
restore life to his country of Belgium; nevertheless, he
insists that his soldiers shall co-operate with all their
remaining strength in the work of deliverance, and that
they shall remain to the end at the post of danger and
honour. Let us salute him with the profoundest reverence.</p>

<p>Another less noble, might have said to himself:</p>

<p>"I have amply paid my debt to the common cause; it
was my troops who built the first rampart against barbarism.
My country, the first to be trampled under the
feet of these German brutes, is no more than a heap of
ruins. That suffices."</p>

<p>But no, he will have the name of Belgium inscribed
upon a yet prouder page, by the side of Serbia, in the
golden book of history.</p>

<p>And that is the reason why I met on my way those
inestimable troops, alert and fresh, miraculously revived,
who were on their way to the front to continue the holy
struggle.</p>

<p>Before him let us bow down to the very ground.</p>

<p>Night is falling when the audience comes to an end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and I find myself again on the footpath that leads to the
abbey. On my return journey, along those roads broken
up by rain and by military transport wagons, I remain
under the charm of his welcome. And I compare these
two monarchs, situated, as it were, at opposite poles of
humanity, the one at the pole of light, the other at the
pole of darkness; the one yonder, swollen with hypocrisy
and arrogance, a monster among monsters, his hands
full of blood, his nails full of torn flesh, who still dares
to surround himself with insolent pomp; the other here,
banished without a murmur to a little house in a village,
standing on a last strip of his martyred kingdom, but in
whose honour rises from the whole civilised earth a concert
of sympathy, enthusiasm, magnificent appreciation,
and for whom are stored up crowns of most pure and
immortal glory.</p>


<h3>V&mdash;A LITTLE JOURNEY TO THE BATTLEGROUNDS
OF FRANCE
</h3>
<div class="center">(Another Story Told by Pierre Loti)</div>

<blockquote>

<p>The blood of the masters is drenching the soil of France. The
great academicians are willing to die that their beloved France
may live. Here we stand on the battleground with this great
French novelist, whose impressions are told in <i>Current History</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the first time that I have found myself so absolutely
and infinitely alone, in the midst of this stage setting
of immense desolation, which to-day, as it chances,
is sparkling with light, and is only the more mournful
for that. Until I reach the little wood to which an errand
of duty calls me I need think of nothing; I need not
occupy myself with anything; I need not avoid the shells,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
which would not give me time to avoid them, nor even
choose the spot to set my foot down, since it sinks in
everywhere equally. And so it comes that I drift back
again to the mood of former days, to my mood of mind
before the war, and all these things to which I have
grown used I see and judge as though they were new.</p>

<p>Only a score of months ago who would have imagined
such a face of things? Thus, these countless excavations&mdash;white,
because the soil of this region is white&mdash;excavations
that stretch on all sides and which mark
across the wilderness multitudes of zebra-tracings&mdash;is it
possible that they mark out the only paths along which
our soldiers of France can move to-day with a sort of
half security?... Little sunken ways, some of them
full of curves, some of them straight, which have been
named "guts," and which we have had to multiply, to
multiply to such a point that the earth is furrowed by
them to infinity! What an enormous sum of toil they
represent, these mole paths, lying in a network over hundreds
of leagues! If we add the trenches, the shelter
caves, all these catacombs that plunge down into the
hearts of the hills, one's mind stops dead before such a
total of excavation, that might seem the work of centuries.</p>

<p>And these things that look like fishing nets stretched
on all sides. If one were not informed in advance and
accustomed to them, could one divine what they can possibly
be? You might think that gigantic spiders had
been spinning their webs among these myriads of posts,
sometimes planted in straight lines, sometimes forming
circles or half moons, tracing across the wide expanse
designs that must be cabalistic in order better to ensnare
and envelop the Barbarians. And besides they have terribly
reinforced them, multiplying them twice, nay, ten
times, since my last passage, these stake nets, and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
web-spinning soldiers have had to make among them
turnings and passages, with the enormous reels of barbed
wire which they carry under their arms.</p>

<p>But there is one thing that you can understand at the
first glance, and which adds to the grim horror of the
whole scene, and that is the inclosures sprinkled here
and there, the wooden fences that shut in closely packed
groups of poor little burial crosses, made of two pieces
of wood. That you can tell at once, alas! and see
exactly what it is! Here they lie, therefore, under the
thunder of the big guns, as though the battle was not yet
finished for them, our dear departed ones, our unknown,
magnificent heroes&mdash;whom even those who weep for them
cannot now come nigh, because death is passing ceaselessly
in the air above their silent little gatherings.</p>

<p>Ah! To complete the unreality of it all, here comes
a black bird of gigantic wing-stretch, a monster of the
apocalypse, that flits past noisily high above me. He
flies on toward France, seeking doubtless the more sheltered
region where women and children begin to be
found, with the hope of slaughtering some of them.</p>


<h3>VI&mdash;"I LOOK DOWN ON THE TERRIBLE
LANDSCAPE"
</h3>
<p>I walk on, if one call it walking, this wearisome and
inexorable process of plunging through the mud. And
finally I arrive at the little grove of trees where we are
to meet. I am glad of it, for my helmet and cloak had
become a heavy burden under this unexpectedly burning
sun. It happens that I am the first to arrive; the officer
whom I have summoned&mdash;to discuss new defense works,
new lines of stake nets, new burrows&mdash;is without doubt
that blue outline making its way hither, but he is still
distant, and I have still a few moments to continue my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
meditation of the way hither before it is time to become
once more concentrated and exact. It is clear that the
place is not left entirely alone, for these poor, half-stripped
branches offer no more resistance than mere
sheets of paper to the huge humming beetles that pass
through them from time to time; but all the same a little
wood like this keeps you company, shuts you in, spreads
something of illusion about you.</p>

<p>I am on a bit of rising ground, from which I look
down on all the terrible landscape, the succession of
monotonous hillocks zebra-streaked by whitish "guts,"
and the few trees disheveled by shrapnel bullets. In the
further distances these intertwined wires, stretched in
all directions, sparkle in the sun, somewhat like "the
Virgin's threads," which spread over the meadows in
Spring. And on all sides the detonations of artillery
keep up their accustomed rumble, which goes on unceasingly
here, night and day, like the roar of the ocean
against the cliffs.</p>

<p>Ah! the huge bird has found some one to speak to in
the air! I see it all at once assailed by a host of those
little tufts of white cotton&mdash;bursting shrapnel&mdash;which
look so innocent, but which are so perilous for birds of
its breed. It turns about hastily; its crimes are put off
for another time.</p>

<p>From behind a nearby rising ground come forth a
group of men in blue, who will reach me before the
officer who is coming over there. It is the chance one,
the one among thousands of these little processions which
one meets incessantly, alas! along the battle front, and
which form, so to speak, part of the stage setting. At
its head four soldiers are carrying a stretcher, and others
are following, to relieve them. Attracted also by the
illusory protection of the branches, they stop instinctively
at the entrance of the little wood to take breath and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
change shoulders. They come from the first-line
trenches, which are three or four kilometers away, and
are carrying a "gravely wounded" man to an underground
hospital, which is some quarter of an hour away.
They also had not foreseen this vicious sun that scorches
one's head; they are wearing their helmets and cloaks,
and they feel the weight of them as much as that of the
precious load which they take such pains to carry steadily;
more, they drag along, on each foot, a thick shell of
sticky mud which gives them feet like elephants, and the
sweat runs in big drops over their fine, tired faces.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with your wounded man?" I ask
in a low voice.</p>

<p>In still lower voices they answer me: "He is ripped
up the belly&mdash;oh! the trench surgeon told us that...."
They finish the sentence only with a shake of the head,
but I understand. For the rest, he has not stirred. His
poor hand remains pressed to his brow and his eyes,
doubtless to protect them against the baking sun, and I
ask: "Why did you not cover his face?" "We did put a
handkerchief over it, Colonel, but he took it away; he
said he would rather have it like that, so that he can still
see something between his fingers."</p>


<h3>VII&mdash;HOW GLORIOUS IS THE SPIRIT OF
FRANCE</h3>

<p>Ah! but the two last men, besides sweat, have broad
smears of blood across their faces and running down
their necks. "Oh, nothing much the matter with us,
Colonel!" they tell me; "we got that as we came along.
We started to carry him along the 'guts,' but it shook
him too much; so we came on outside in the open."
Poor, admirable dreamer! To save their wounded man
from jolting they have risked all their lives! Two or
three of these huge death beetles which ceaselessly hum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
past have smashed themselves near them against the
stones and have sprinkled them with their fragments;
the Germans do not take the trouble to shoot at a single
passerby like myself, but a group, and especially a litter,
is irresistible for them. Of the two who are streaming
with blood, one is, perhaps, not much the worse, but the
other has an ear torn off, and hanging only by a shred
of skin.</p>

<p>"You must get your wound dressed by the surgeon
immediately, my friend," I say to him.</p>

<p>"Yes, Colonel, we are on our way there to the hospital.
It suits exactly."</p>

<p>That is the only thing that has occurred to him to say
in complaint: "It suits exactly." And he says it with
such a fine, quiet smile, while thanking me for taking an
interest in him.</p>

<p>I hesitate to go closer to look at their gravely wounded
man, who has remained without stirring, for fear I
might disturb his last thoughts. I do go close to him,
however, very gently, because they are going to carry
him away.</p>

<p>Ah! He is a mere lad! A village boy; one can guess
that at once by his bronzed cheeks, which have just begun
to grow pale. The sun, as he wishes, floods his handsome
20-year-old face, which is at the same time vigorous
and candid, and his hand is still held like a guard
before his eyes, which are set and seem no longer to
perceive anything. They must have given him morphine
to keep him from suffering too much. Humble child of
our countryside, brief little life, what is he dreaming of,
if he is still dreaming? Perhaps of his kerchiefed
mamma, who wept happy tears every time she recognized
his childish writing on an envelope from the front? Or
is he dreaming of the farm garden that held his earliest
years?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>I see on his breast the handkerchief with which they
tried to cover his face; it is of fine linen, embroidered
with a Marquis's coronet&mdash;the coronet of one of his
bearers. He had wanted "to go on seeing things," doubtless
in his terror of the great night. But even this sun,
which must dazzle him, will soon cease suddenly to be
recognizable for him; to begin with, it will be the half-darkness
of the hospital, and, immediately afterward,
will begin for him the long inexorable night, in which no
sun will ever dawn again.</p>

<h2>"VIVE LA FRANCE"&mdash;HOW MEN DIE
FOR THEIR COUNTRY</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Last Messages of French Soldiers</i><br />
<br />
<i>Told by Rene Bazin, Member of the French Academy</i><br />
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Behind the dry official reports of military events is a vast fund
of emotional human stories. Glimpses of this side of the
Great War are found in private letters, personal experiences,
and thrilling episodes of courage, humor, or pathos which are
being preserved in the New York Times <i>Current History</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I have heard magnificent sayings of our soldiers;
others have been written to me by those who heard them.
I would not have them perish. It seems to me that they
naturally form a part of the epoch we are living through;
that they are good to read and meditate on, unconscious
testimonies of that which historians will call the new life
of France, of that which has ever been her deeper life,
widened and developed in this hour of trial.</p>

<p>Therefore I shall record here not all these sayings and
traits, but some of them.</p>

<p>At B., in the hospital of the Grand Hotel, a wounded
soldier was to have a limb amputated. But he was so
weak that the surgeon hesitated.</p>

<p>"If we could only give him some blood!"</p>

<p>"If that is all that is needed I am ready to give it!"
answers another wounded soldier, a Breton.</p>

<p>The transfusion is made. The staff of the hospital,
touched by the devotion of this wounded soldier, who
was known to be very poor, made a little collection here
and there, very quietly, and gathered five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
francs, which they took great satisfaction in offering to
him. One day one of them came close to his bed, spoke
of the service he had rendered, thanked him and offered
him the money. Mark his answer:</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I give my blood; I do not sell it!"</p>

<p>A very young soldier from the North, with a beardless
and rather childish face, is stretched at the back of a
trench, dying from a terrible shell wound in the stomach.
In spite of the frightful wound he does not complain,
he does not repine, and in his wide, upward-gazing eyes
one could just perceive the expression of sadness which
he often had. For since mobilizing he had received no
news from his home in the occupied territory. His comrades
are doing what they can for him, offering him
water to drink, unbuttoning his tunic, trying to stanch
the blood. Opening his eyes, which he had kept for a
long moment closed, and no longer with an expression
of suffering, he said to one of his comrades, a big, hairy
fellow who was bending over him:</p>

<p>"Friend, you must not tell mother what a frightful
wound I had! A bullet is better than what I have!"
Then he distributed a few little things he had in his
pocket&mdash;his knife, his purse, a corkscrew, a tinder-box&mdash;a
last testament soon ended. Finally, with difficulty, he
opened his notebook and, setting himself to write, though
he could no longer see very clearly, he traced a few
lines. When he had finished his soul departed....
Three minutes later, as the word of his end spread along
the trench, at this time not under heavy bombardment
by the enemy, a Captain arrived, smeared with mud up
to the shoulders. He saw the soldier. "Oh, poor boy!
One of my bravest!" Respectfully he took the notebook,
which had fallen on the ground, opened it and read:
"Au revoir, father; au revoir, mother; au revoir, little
sisters; I am dying for my country. Vive la France!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Sergeant Raissac of Beziers was mortally wounded in
an assault on a German trench. When they lifted his
body his hand still held a photograph representing his
mother, his sisters and himself, and on the back of the
picture he had managed to write, with his last effort,
"Adieu! No tears, but a Christian acceptance. I am at
peace with God."</p>

<p>Yesterday, during his two days' leave, I met the son
of a poor countrywoman, a workman whom I have loved
for a long time. When I took leave of him, saying,
"Good luck to you, Marcel!" he looked up with unreproaching
eyes and answered me: "On the one side, and
on the other, I fear nothing!" And this meant: "Life?
Death? What does it matter? I am ready!"</p>

<p>What does all this signify? It is the poetry of chivalry
that continues; it is the unfinished Crusade; it is God
making Himself manifest through purified France.</p>

<p>Those who seek the sublime will find nothing grander.</p>


<h3>II&mdash;THE YOUNG HEROES OF FRANCE</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Told by Maurice Barrès, in memory of Max Barthou,
who volunteered at eighteen</i></div>

<p>I believe that young heroes abound at this moment
when every family is cruelly involved in the war. The
son dreams of helping his father, his elder brothers, of
joining them, of avenging them. Are his city and his
home invaded? With his whole heart he tries and examines
himself as to what his duty and his honour demand.
I remember how the minds of my companions,
some 10 years old, and our slightly older brothers were
fired in 1870....</p>

<p>Do you wish me to bring you my contribution to the
monument of our young patriots?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>First, a little story. On Nov. 24, 1914, on a cold day,
about 3 in the afternoon, the Prussians, whom they call
"Boches," are once again trying to cross the frontier, to
enter France. It is very cold, there is a high wind, and
snow covers the ground. Who tells the story? A workman
at the front, who, from the neighbourhood of Pont-à-Mousson,
writes to his two little children at his home
at Neuillez sur Marne. They gave me his letter. I
should spoil it if I retouched it. I transcribe it just as
it is:</p>

<p>"My dear little Marcella, this story, which happened to
some French soldiers, you are to tell to your little Charlie
and your companions, and you are to show them how
two little children saved the lives of twenty-eight papas.</p>

<p>"In a lonely farmhouse a detachment of reservists,
composed of thirty men, are resting from the labours of
the night in an underground cellar, waiting for the next
night to begin their work again and accomplish their
mission.</p>

<p>In a room about them, two children, Liza and John,
are sitting beside their mamma near the fire. All three
talk the old country dialect. All at once the mother rises,
runs to the door and sees some horsemen coming from a
distance.</p>

<p>"'My children,' she says, pressing them to her heart,
'I think the Prussians are coming. They will see that we
have lodged and fed French soldiers, and they will surely
want to make us tell where they are. They will take
them and shoot them.'</p>

<p>"'We must say they have gone away there, just in
the opposite direction!' said little John.</p>

<p>"'Oh, no!' said their mamma; 'if we deceive them
with a lie they will come back and take vengeance. Listen
rather! I shall speak to the Prussians only in dialect,
and they won't understand a word. Do you also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
do as I do, and, to everything they say, answer always
in the same phrase, in dialect.'</p>

<p>"The clatter of hoofs was heard, and the rattle of
weapons.</p>

<p>"'Courage, my children!' said their mamma. The
door opens. The Boches enter. They ask questions, but
the mother's answers are unintelligible to them.</p>

<p>"'Look at these two children! They must learn
French at school,' said the officer, who spoke a little
French.</p>

<p>"One of the Germans seized little Lisa, while another
caught little John.</p>

<p>"'Where is your father?' he asked in a harsh voice.
'Where are the French that passed here?'</p>

<p>"Lisa raised her blue eyes to this foreign soldier and,
all trembling, replied in dialect. John did the same. The
soldiers, irritated, suspecting a trick, searched the house,
but did not find the trap-door which had been previously
covered with dirty straw. They threatened to cut the
children's throats. They told them they would kill their
mother, too, if they did not answer. The poor children
began to cry, but, faithful to their mother's directions,
they repeated, through their tears, the same phrase.</p>

<p>"The French soldiers who were in the cellar and who
heard everything through a ventilator felt their blood
boil, and, but for their officer, would have come forth to
protect the poor children, and, without doubt, would have
been killed, for they were outnumbered.</p>

<p>"The Prussians did not think that such young children,
threatened with death, would be capable of such
heroic discretion; they ended by believing that they could
not make themselves understood and rode away.</p>

<p>"And that is how two little children, Lisa, aged 8, and
John, aged 10, by their obedience to their mother and by
courage kept thirty men from being killed, twenty-eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
wives still have their husbands, and forty-seven little
children have their papas. Among these forty-seven little
children my little Marcella and my little Charlie will
perhaps see their papa again."</p>

<p>I leave this story in its fine simplicity. A workman
who had become a soldier chats with his children far
away. But the chief attraction in it for me is that the
fact reported is quite authentic. I know the farm in the
district of Meurthe et Moselle, and later on I shall tell
its name, as well as those of the farmer's wife and the
two children, who have received a well-earned reward.</p>

<h2>FOR GOD AND ITALY&mdash;BREATHING
DEATH WITH THE ITALIANS</h2>

<div class="center">"<i>Where Minutes Are Eternal</i>"<br /><br />
<i>Told by Gabriele D'Annunzio, Italy's Most Famous
Living Poet and a Lieutenant in the Italian Navy</i><br />
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>The great D'Annunzio, like most of the famous poets, painters,
and composers of Europe, is offering his life to his country.
He is a Lieutenant in the Italian Navy. Occasionally some
word is heard from him in which we see war through the eyes
of the poet. He sent this graphic description of his experiences
as a mine-layer to the <i>London Telegraph</i> of December 29, 1915.</p></blockquote>


<h3>I&mdash;A POET AT SEA WITH THE ITALIAN NAVY</h3>

<p>It can be said of the Italian war what Percy Bysshe
Shelley said of the Medusa's head which he saw in Florence,
and which he attributed to Leonardo da Vinci: "Its
beauty and its horror are divine."</p>

<p>This night of danger and death is one of the sweetest
that ever spread its blue veil over the face of the heavens.
The sea darkens, and in its innumerable pulsations
the nocturnal phosphoresence is already discernible.
Here and there the rippled surface of the sea glitters with
an internal light as a quivering eyelid, disclosing mysterious
glances. The new moon is like a burning handful
of sulphur. Ever and anon the black cloud of smoke
rising from the funnels hides it or appears to drag it in
its spirals like a moving flame.</p>

<p>Life is not an abstraction of aspects and events, but
a sort of diffused sensuousness, a knowledge offered to
all the senses, a substance good to touch, smell, taste,
feel. In fact, I feel all the things near to my senses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
like the fisherman walking barefooted on the beach covered
with the incoming tide, and who now and then bends
to identify and pick up what moves under the soles of
his feet. The aspects of this maritime city are like my
passions and like the monuments of Nineveh and Knossus,
places of my ardor and creations of my fancy, real
and unreal, products of my desire and products of time.
This city is one of those tumultuous harmonies whence
often the most beautiful elements of my art are born.
Nothing escapes the eyes Nature gave me, and everything
is food for my soul. Such a craving for life is not unlike
the desire to die in order to achieve immortality.</p>

<p>In fact, to-night death is present like life, beautiful as
life, intoxicating, full of promises, transfiguring. I stand
on my feet, wearing shoes that can easily be unlaced,
on the deck of a small ironclad on which there is only
space enough for the weapons and the crew. Steam is
up. The black smoke of the three funnels rises toward
the new moon, shining yellow in the cloud, burning like
a handful of sulphur. The sailors have already donned
life-saving belts and inflated the collars which must support
the head in the agony of drowning. I hear the
voice of the second officer giving the order to place in
the only two boats the biscuits and the canned meat.</p>

<p>A young officer, muscular, but agile as a leopard, who
has Boldness' very eyes, and has to his credit already an
admirable manoeuvre in conducting the destroyer from
the arsenal to the anchorage, pays for the champagne.
We drink a cup sitting around the table on which the
navigation chart is spread, while the commander of the
flotilla dictates, standing, to the typist the order of the
nocturnal operation, which is to be issued to the commanders
of the other ships. A suppressed joy shines in
the eyes of all. The operation is fraught with danger,
is most difficult, and the cup we drink may be our last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>An ensign, who is little more than a boy, and a Sicilian,
who resembles an adolescent Arabian brought up in the
court of Frederick of Serbia, rubs in his hands a perfumed
leaf, one of those leaves which are grown in a
terra cotta vase on the parapets of the windows looking
into the silent lanes of the city. The perfume is so
strong that every one of us smells it with quivering nostrils.
That single leaf on that terrible warship, where
everything is iron and fire, that leaf of love, seems to us
infinitely precious, and reminds us of the gardens of
Giudecca and Fondamenta Nuove left behind.</p>

<p>The commander continues to dictate the order of the
operation with his soft Tuscan accent, with some same
telling words that Ramondo d'Amoretto Manelli used in
the epistle he sent to Leonard Strozzi when the Genoese
were vanquished by the navy of the Venetians and Florentines.</p>


<h3>II&mdash;"WE ARE GOING TO PLANT MINES ON A
HOSTILE COAST"</h3>

<p>Ours is a marvelous exploit. We are going to plant
mines near the enemy's coast, only a bare kilometer from
its formidable batteries. The ensign fastens the black
collar around his neck, and will presently inflate it with
his breath.</p>

<p>We are ready. We sail. The firmament over our
heads is covered with smoke and sparks. Along the gunwale,
on each side of the ship, the enormous mines in
their iron cages rest on the supports projecting over the
water. The long torpedoes are ready for the attack, protected
by their iron tubes, with their bronze heads charged
with trytol, beasts in ambuscade. The sailors, their heads
covered, are grouped around the guns, whose breeches
are open. All the available space is strewn with weapons
and contrivances, and full of alert men. In order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to go from stern to prow it is necessary to crouch, bend,
pass under a greasy torpedo, leap over outstretched sailors,
strike the leg against the fastening of a torpedo,
squeeze against a hot funnel, entangle one's self in a rope,
receive squarely in the face a dash of foam while grasping
the railing.</p>

<p>I ascend the bridge. We are already clear of the anchorage.
It is dark. The moon is dipping in the sea.
In an hour it will have disappeared. The ship quivers
at the vibration of the machinery. The funnels still emit
too much smoke and too many sparks. On board all the
lights are out, even the cigarettes. Darkness enshrouds
alike both prow and stern. The last order megaphoned
resounds in an azure dotted with sparks and stars&mdash;which
are only inextinguishable sparks. A light mist rises from
the water. The wake foams, and the sea ahead parts in
two broad furrows along the sides of the ship, giving
forth, now and then, strange reflections.</p>

<p>Following in our wake the second destroyer looms up
darkly, and after her all the others in line. When the
route is changed to reconnoitre the coast, from the great
central wake many oblique ones part, designing an immense
silver rake.</p>

<p>The commander is against the railing, leaning out toward
darkness, with his whole soul in his scrutinizing
eyes. Now and then he turns his ruddy face and transmits
an order with exact and sharp words. The helmsman
at the wheel never once removes his eyes from the
compass, lighted by a small lamp in a screened niche.
Clearly he is a man of the purest Tyrrenean race, a true
comrade of Ulysses, with a face which seems to have
been modeled by the trade wind. Near by is the signal
box. "Half Speed," "Full Speed," "Slow," "Stop."
Through the speaking tube the orders are transmitted to
the engine room. "Four&mdash;Three&mdash;Zero."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>We are making twenty-three knots an hour. The foam
of the great wake glitters under the stern lights. "A
little to the right."</p>

<p>The navigating officer is bending over the chart, held
down by lead weights covered with cloth, measuring, figuring
with the compass and the square, under the blue
light of a shaded lamp. A great shooting star crosses
the August sky, disappearing toward the Cappella.</p>


<h3>III&mdash;A DRAMATIC MOMENT IN THE NIGHT</h3>

<p>Impatience gnaws my heart. I strain my sight to discern
in the darkness the signal which has been prearranged.
Nothing is to be seen yet. I descend from the
ladder and move toward the stern, skirting the row of
torpedoes, leaping over the outstretched sailors. From
the stern the dark silhouettes of the other destroyers in
line are visible. All of a sudden the signal is flashed in
the direction of the prow. We are nearing the spot of
our operation. Every will is strained.</p>

<p>"One&mdash;Two&mdash;Zero."</p>

<p>The speed is reduced to six knots. The funnels still
emit too much smoke and too many sparks. The commander
is furious. Orders are megaphoned and every
word seems to crowd the adventurous air with danger.
The manoeuvre is executed with sort of rhythmic precision.
Maintaining their distance, and one by one, every
ship files to the starboard of us, standing black over the
foaming wake, lighted every now and then by a strange
phosphorescence.</p>

<p>"On reaching the eastern route for the planting of the
mines, extinguish the stern lights," cries the megaphone.
Under the playing searchlights the enemy's coast is clearly
visible. We are in low water, and the speed is further
diminished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"One&mdash;Zero&mdash;Zero."</p>

<p>We almost touch bottom, and proceed by feeling our
course ahead. We also take soundings continuously to
avoid running aground. The ships seem to pant and puff
grievedly, as great mammals in danger of running ashore.</p>

<p>"Reverse engines. Full speed!"</p>

<p>One of the ships feels she cannot manoeuvre any
longer, having actually struck bottom, and endeavors to
free herself. She lies ahead of us, and within speaking
distance. We see the water glitter under the blue light
of her stern lanterns. It seems to us now that every other
ship is in danger. The sky is veiled. Long Medusan
tresses of clouds drag the constellation as the net drags
silvery fishes. The engines throb painfully.</p>

<p>The commander is there, all soul, defying the darkness
with his eyes. What if at that moment the enemy should
sight us?</p>

<p>"The <i>Invitto</i> leads."</p>

<p>His clear orders through a series of manoeuvres draw
away the flotilla from the shallow waters and on to the
safe course. Beyond, on the shore, the enemy's searchlights
are seen crossing each other like white blades. Under
the light the shore seems so near as to give one the
illusion of being about to drop anchor. We are all tensely
waiting. In a few seconds we shall be in the prearranged
spot. Minutes seem hours. The rubber stoppers have
been removed from the tubes. The mines are ready, on
their supports, to be lowered into the sea. The sailors
await the order standing.</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;"WE BREATHE DANGER AND DEATH"</h3>

<p>The minutes are eternal. We may be detected every
second. The shore is only a mile from us. The funnels
are our despair. They still emit too much smoke and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
sparks. At last a warning is heard from the bridge.</p>

<p>"Ready."</p>

<p>The Lieutenant looks at his watch, lighting the dial
with the lamp hidden in his hand. The enormous mines,
whose heads are charged with destruction, are there
silent, like gigantic, gray, petrified sea Medusas, fixed on
their support, whose double tooth projects over the
waters.</p>

<p>"Ready! Let go!"</p>

<p>The first mine rolls over with the sound of a shattering
barrel, falls in the foaming sea, disappears.</p>

<p>"Ready! Let go!"</p>

<p>Eighteen seconds elapse. The second falls, followed
by the third, fourth, and all the others, on every ship
which maintains a diagonal course nearing the coast. In
three minutes the operation is over; the mines are planted
in the exact spot. The teeth of the crew gleam in a wild
smile. Each sailor sees in his heart the enemy's battleships
rent and sinking.</p>

<p>"Four&mdash;Three&mdash;Three&mdash;Zero."</p>

<p>We assume our position at the head of the line, returning
on our course with the initial speed. The ships
seem now to me to be quivering with warlike joy. In
the distance over the mainland the white beams of the
searchlights still cross each other. Ever and anon a rocket
explodes. Our wake now is so beautiful as to resemble
a whirling milky way. A sailor mounts the bridge and
gives us a cup of steaming coffee, whose aroma titillates
our nostrils and our heart. We light our cigarette.</p>

<p>But here is a Marconigram.</p>

<p>"Look out, two submarines are lying in wait for you
on the safe route."</p>

<p>And in the first quiver of dawn, with expanded lungs,
we again breathe danger and death.</p>

<h3>I&mdash;"I CAN SEE THE SCENE UNFOLDING
BEFORE MY EYES"</h3>

<p>The war relics of devastated structures leave a sad and
painful impression. Of the many deserted battlefields
which I have seen during the two years past, the nameless
little graves faintly marked with little wooden crosses, of
the deserted trenches, nothing gave me so much food for
deep and sad reflection as the bare and lonely chimneys
projecting from amid piles of rubbish, melancholy blackened
pots, the scattered remnants of domesticity; a
smashed pail, a broken wheel, a binding of a torn book,
the splinters of what was once a crib.</p>

<p>To think that hereabout dwelt a family; that they were
contented and possibly happy! Those walls, stripped and
crumbled, what have they not seen!</p>

<p>It always seems to me that an event having occurred
at a given place, the memory of the occurrence attaches
permanently to it. Whenever I happened to find myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in a locality in which some memorable events had taken
place I could not think of those events without at the
same time visualizing the surroundings amid which they
occurred; and the more recent the occurrence, the more
vividly I can see the scene unfolding itself before my
eyes.</p>

<p>The vast number of such impressions which the present
war has produced make a film, vivid and endless.</p>


<h3>II&mdash;"I REMEMBER ... A HORRIBLE TALE"</h3>

<p>I remember one such pile of ruins, which I saw not far
from the road leading to Jaroslav. This ruin remained
permanently fixed in my memory by reason of a horrible
tale connected with it.</p>

<p>Some time ago there lived on a farm a well-to-do Galician
gardener. When the war broke out he was drafted
into the army. He went forth, leaving behind him a wife
and three small children. Shortly following his departure,
troops commenced appearing in the immediate
neighborhood. At first came small detachments, but these
were quickly followed by more formidable bodies. In
a short time lines of trenches were dug on both sides
of the farm and real warfare began.</p>

<p>The firing was continuous. The family sought safety
in the corners of their hut. They hid in the cellar under
the heaps of beets and potatoes, but the children soon
became accustomed to the hissing of bullets and lost all
fear of them.</p>

<p>The wounded soldiers, for the most part Austrians,
began crawling toward the farm. There they bound up
their wounds. The children looked on and sometimes
gave aid, holding with their tiny fingers the blood-soaked
cotton, or winding long and transparent bandages around
the wounded limbs. They became accustomed to pain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and to the groans of the dying, and in their naive and
simple way rendered all the help of which they were
capable.</p>

<p>At night, when darkness fell and when firing from
both sides would cease, the Austrian relief workers would
come, place the wounded on long and unsteady stretchers,
and carry them to the rear. On one occasion the wounded
sent the eldest girl to the pond to fetch some water. She
stayed away for a long, long time. Later she was found
lying on the grass with a bullet in her slender little shoulder.
The pails lay near her empty.</p>

<p>During the night she, too, was placed on a stretcher and
was carried away. With her went the mother and the
rest of the children. From that night on the farm remained
forsaken.</p>

<p>The wounded, however, continued crawling to the hut,
their numbers increasing from day to day. At times the
litter bearers could not manage to look into the farm,
and the wounded lay for days at a stretch without aid.</p>


<h3>III&mdash;"THERE WAS NO ONE TO BURY THE
BODIES"</h3>

<p>At the end of October a serious cholera epidemic broke
out among the Austrian troops. From that time on there
appeared among those creeping toward the lonely farm
large numbers of emaciated and pale-blue forms&mdash;shadows
of men. On reaching the farm they fell on to the straw,
coiled and groaned in agony, and for the most part remained
lying there, silenced by everlasting sleep.</p>

<p>There was no one to bury the bodies, and they gradually
began decomposing. On top of those bodies fell
more and more. It became impossible to live amid these
hellish surroundings, and if by chance some unfortunate
wounded happened to come along most of them would
leave the little hut and limp ahead, preferring to dare the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
firing line rather than be stifled in this horrible atmosphere
of death and stench.</p>

<p>The engagements, having lasted several weeks, became
more and more stubborn. The trenches crept nearer and
nearer, until they resembled two live, gigantic horns about
to embrace each other. Presently one of the Austrian
trenches came so near the farm that the house became
an obstacle to firing, and an order was issued to apply
the torch to the incumbrance.</p>

<p>It was a dangerous task; all knew through experience
that the Russians keep a sharp lookout on all that transpires
in the enemy line and do not allow to pass with
impunity the most insignificant move on the part of the
enemy. At night the men, while smoking, would lie low
at the very base of the trench, as the mere striking of a
match sufficed to draw fire from the opposite lines.</p>

<p>As a result of some faint noise or a slight movement,
vigorous firing would not infrequently burst out all along
the line, and instead of getting the much-needed rest, the
soldiers would pass nights on their feet and remain
fatigued from sleeplessness and nervous exertion.</p>

<p>A young Second Lieutenant, recently promoted, and
clean-shaven, volunteered to apply the torch. Though an
ambitious man, he was at the same time limited and cowardly.
He always tried to conceal his cowardice under a
mask of arrogance, pushing his way forward whenever
there was an opportunity to get into the spotlight and
have his name mentioned. To brace himself, the officer
emptied a large glass of spirits, and, taking along one of
the men, left a cozy, sheltered trench and began feeling
his way across the fields.</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;THE TORCH AT THE HOUSE OF DEATH</h3>

<p>The night was dark as a grave, and over the lowland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of the garden hung a thick, milky fog. The feet sank
deep into the sticky, soaking mud. The Lieutenant's assistant
went slowly, bent to the ground and breathing
heavily.</p>

<p>They continued on their way without seeing anything
ahead. Though the distance between them and their object
was only 200 yards, it seemed to them from time to
time as if they had lost their bearings and were going
in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Soon they were aware of a heavy, suffocating smell;
the next moment there loomed up before their eyes a
sombre silhouette of a building. It stood there enveloped
in fog.</p>

<p>Reaching a corner of the house, the Lieutenant stopped
short, drew from his ulster a big field revolver and whispered
to the man to come near.</p>

<p>It seemed that his main care was not to carry out the
task he had undertaken, but to hide conveniently from the
Russian fire, and then slip off to the rear as soon as the
house caught fire. He figured that while the flames were
spreading over the structure, and before they had reached
the last wall, he could quietly and without the least danger
remain under shelter. As soon as the fire enveloped
the structure, and before the walls began crumbling, he
would run back in time to avoid exposure by the conflagration.</p>

<p>With this in view, he gave orders to his subordinate to
pile up straw on the side of the building directly facing
the trenches. In the meantime the officer, having taken
shelter behind the opposite wall, lit a cigar and remained
waiting for developments.</p>

<p>A few moments of long and painful suspense followed.
The poor Lieutenant was in a state of frenzy. It was
not the personal danger alone that now excited his imagination.
He was tormented by the mystic fear of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
which he was about to carry out. In the darkness he
drew a sombre sketch of all that was hidden behind the
wall, the inevitable which he was to face within a few
moments.</p>

<p>How many of them are there? In what stage of decomposition?
How do they lie?</p>

<p>The officer suddenly recalled a conversation in which
some one had told him that when the flames touched the
dead in the crematory they coiled and twisted as if alive.
In his excited imagination he quickly pictured a wild
dance of the dead which was about to begin.</p>

<p>"When they calm down," he thought, "after they are
burned, as soon as roast meat is scented I will run, and
then let the Russians shoot at them. All I have to do is
to get away in time. If we were only done with this!
Quick! Quick!"</p>

<p>At this moment he became aware of a pleasant smell of
straw smoke, and immediately afterward the opposite
corner of the structure burst into a bright flame. Almost
simultaneously with the flash firing began from the Russian
trenches, and it seemed to the officer that a few
bullets hissed near him.</p>

<p>The soldier succeeded in pouring a great quantity of
kerosene into the interior of the house. The fire spread
with unusual swiftness. In two minutes the structure
was all ablaze.</p>


<h3>V&mdash;"THESE WERE THE HORRIBLE VISIONS"</h3>

<p>The officer stood at the open door, watching curiously
the interior of the main room. Scattered all over the
floor there lay contorted and twisted forms. They lay in
irregular heaps. It was an appalling and gruesome sight.
From somewhere protruded some one's long, bare legs;
near the wall lingered a lonely arm, curled, swollen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
slightly lifted, it hung in a threatening posture; from under
a tattered old military coat projected a thick brush
of black-blue hair; and at some distance, leaning on the
furnace, there half sat the mighty figure of a stately
corpse. The majestic body was bent in gloom, two huge,
rough, and calloused hands supporting a big head.</p>

<p>Suddenly it seemed to the Lieutenant as if he heard
some one groan. The sound became more and more
audible, coming nearer and nearer; one voice, a second,
somebody called, a cry rang out, and suddenly pandemonium
broke loose. Air-rending cries came from all sides,
and men began to drop, one by one, falling about the
officer and stretching at his feet. Some fell straight from
the ceiling to the earthen floor, others came creeping down
the ladder; they dropped into the flames, choking and
writhing in deadly agony.</p>

<p>The officer, half dead from fright, drew his revolver
and opened fire. He ceased firing when his supply of
bullets gave out. His ammunition gone, the Lieutenant
threw down the weapon and ran. No one will ever
know the number of unfortunates he thus killed. All I
know is that of all the men hiding in the garret of that
farm only one was saved. It was he who told me this
terrible tale. He did this while lying in one of our hospitals.
According to his version, there were at the time
in the building a great number of wounded soldiers, who
had come there during the last engagement. When fire
was set to the house, they endeavored to get down. All
perished. Some were burned alive, while others were
shot to death by their own officer. Among those who
perished was also the soldier who had served as the
Lieutenant's assistant.</p>

<p>These were the horrible visions. I saw them every
time I chanced to pass the ruined and devastated spot.</p>

<p>The fate of the vain and unhappy officer does not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the least concern me. I am not even disposed to blame
him for his weakness. For this we can only pity a man.
One is bound to pity also those who met death at his
hands.</p>

<p>But for some reason or other I cannot help remembering
the wounded little girl. There she lay, dying from
loss of blood; there at the turning of the footpath, near
the two little birch trees.</p>

<h2>MY EXPERIENCES IN THE WAR
HOSPITALS OF RUMANIA</h2>

<div class="center"><i>The Horrors of the Little Balkan Kingdom</i><br /><br />
<i>Told by Queen Marie of Rumania</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>Driven into exile with her many subjects, who had to retreat
before the Hun just as the Belgians and Serbians were forced
out of their peaceful homes in the debacle of war, Queen Marie
of Rumania turned to the pen, and with it pictured the horrors
that have engulfed the pretty little Balkan kingdom. Queen
Marie was married to King Ferdinand in 1893, and was then
the Princess Marie of Edinburgh, the daughter of Alfred I,
Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Prince of Great Britain and Ireland.
Noted for her beauty, idolized by her people, she has
devoted herself to Red Cross work and the care of her stricken
people ever since the entry of Rumania into the war. In devoting
her pen to the cause of her adopted country, Queen
Marie has followed the example of her husband's aunt, the late
Queen Elizabeth (Carmen Sylva), whose charming books of
poetry and prose deal almost entirely with the customs and
folklore of Rumania. In this article in the <i>Philadelphia Public
Ledger</i> Queen Marie gives a graphic picture of war-torn
Rumania.</p></blockquote>


<h3>I&mdash;"I WATCH MY RUMANIANS GO TO WAR"</h3>

<p>The trains are passing ... passing ... and the
cargo they are hurrying thither is the youth of our country
and the hope of our homes....</p>

<p>By thousands they are massed together; they sit on
the roofs of the wagons, they hang on to their sides, they
balance themselves in perilous positions, but all of them
are gay, ... they shout, they sing, they laugh....</p>

<p>And the trains pass, pass ... all day the trains pass....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
With hands full of flowers we hurry to the stations;
our hearts are heavy; we long to say words they will
remember, to tell them what we feel, but their voices
raised in chorus drown all we would say.</p>

<p>One cry is on every lip when they see me, "We are
going! Going gladly, going to victory, so that you may
become Empress&mdash;Empress of all the Rumanians!"
There is hardly a voice that does not say it; it is the cry
of every heart; they hope it, they believe it, they mean
it to me, and I smile back at them offering them my
flowers, which they clutch at with eager hands.</p>

<p>And thus the trains pass ... pass....</p>


<h3>II&mdash;"THE SOLDIERS SHOWERED ME WITH
FLOWERS"</h3>

<p>One evening the sun was going down in glowing
glory, turning all it shone over into glittering gold. I
was late, other duties having kept me back; the train I
had come to greet was already moving away.</p>

<p>In joyous crowds the young soldiers thronged the
carriages; others had been before me to deck their caps,
their tunics, even their horses and cannons, with bright
violet asters of every shade. The prodigious radiance of
sunset fell over all those flowers, enhancing their beauty,
as though even the heavens were doing their utmost to
render more blessed the departure of those eager boys,
who so gayly were going to death.</p>

<p>Hurriedly I ran toward the moving carriages, distressed
at being late. A great shout mounted from a
thousand throats as they recognized me and a shower of
flowers fell at my feet.</p>

<p>From their caps, their tunics, their cannons they tore
away the flowers that had been given them to shower
them over their Queen, while the usual chorus mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to the skies: "May you become Empress&mdash;Empress of
all the Rumanians."...</p>

<p>And always more flowers fell over me; my arms were
full; my hands could hardly hold them; the ground was
purple where I stood....</p>

<p>Long did I remain there after the train had disappeared.
A trail of smoke against the orange sky alone
marked its passage, and all those fading flowers at my
feet.</p>

<p>As one looks at the incomprehensible, I gazed at those
two long rails running into the infinite, there seeming to
join their separate ways, and wondered toward what fate
those youths were hurrying; wondered if their dream
would be realized; especially I wondered how many
would come back....</p>

<p>The sun had set, the smoke had dissolved into nothing;
the voices of my soldiers were but a remembrance
... slowly I turned my foot toward home....</p>


<h3>III&mdash;"I BEND OVER THE SUFFERING FACES"</h3>

<p>All day long I have been moving among the wounded,
wandering from ward to ward&mdash;they all want me to come
among them, each soldier desirous to see his Queen....</p>

<p>Never do I leave a call unanswered; everywhere do I
go; no sight is too sad, no fatigue is too great, no way
too long, but sometimes it is to me as though I were
wandering through some never-ending dream.</p>

<p>Bed beside bed they lie there, and all eyes meet me,
follow me, consume me; never before have I known what
it means to be the prey of so many eyes.... They seem
to be drawing my heart from my bosom, to be a weight
I can hardly bear!</p>

<p>I bend over suffering faces, clasp outstretched hands,
lay my fingers upon heated brows, gaze into dying eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
listen to whispered words&mdash;and everywhere the same
wish follows me: "May you become Empress&mdash;Empress
of all the Rumanians!" Stiffening lips murmur it to me,
hopeful voices cry it out to me; it goes with me wherever
I move: "What matters our suffering as long as you become
Empress&mdash;Empress of all the Rumanians!" Infinitely
touching are the words when they mount toward
me from the beds of so many wounded, who see in me
the realization, the incarnation of the dream for which
they are giving their lives.</p>

<p>It makes me feel so small, so humble before their
stoic endurance; tears come to my eyes and yet, because
of the beauty of it, I have a great wish to thank God.</p>

<p>Why should I be chosen to represent an ideal? Why
should just I be the symbol? What right have I to stand
above them, to buy glory with the shedding of their
blood?...</p>

<p>And always more tenderly do I pass from bed to
bed....</p>

<p>That was at a time when hope still sang in every soul,
when in the first enthusiasm all hearts beat in unison,
when belief in glorious victory gladdened the day....</p>

<p>But much later, under widely different circumstances
in quite another place, the same words were said to me
by one who could not see my face, for that morning he
had been trepanned; his bandaged head was lying in a
pool of blood....</p>

<p>Some one told him that his Queen was beside him,
that she had come to see him, to inquire about his sufferings;
to help him if he needed help.</p>

<p>A groping hand was stretched out toward me; I took
it in mine, whispering words of comfort; bending low
toward the parched lips that were murmuring something
that at first I could not understand. The man had no
face, no eyes; all was swathed in blood-stained cloths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Then, as though from very far, came the words, the
same brave words: "May the great God protect you.
May He let you live to become Empress&mdash;Empress of all
the Rumanians!"</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;"I PRAYED TO GOD TO LISTEN"</h3>

<p>It was to me as though something very wonderful had
quite suddenly descended upon the distress of my soul,
something very holy, very beautiful; but that was almost
more than I could bear.... Touching had been that
wish when hope shone before us like a star, but now it
was more than touching, it was grand and sacred, for it
was pronounced at an hour when darkest disaster had
overthrown our land, when inch by inch our armies were
retreating before the all-invading foe. There in that
chamber of suffering those dying lips still spoke of the
hope they clung to, of the dream that, in spite of sacrifice,
death and misery, one day must surely come true....</p>

<p>That dying man was but one of many, a voice out of
the unknown, a martyr without a name; but his words
had gone home to my heart.</p>

<p>As I bent over him, laying my hand gently upon his
crimson-stained rags, I prayed to God to listen to his
wish; prayed that the blood of so many humble heroes
should not be given in vain; prayed that when that great
hour of liberation should sound at last an echo of the
shout of victory that that day would sound over all our
land should reach the heart of this nameless one beyond
the shadow into which he was sinking, so that even
beyond the grave he should still have a share in the
glory his living eyes were not destined to see....</p>

<h2>"WITH THE GERMAN ARMIES IN
THE WEST"&mdash;VISITS TO THE
GENERAL STAFF</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Told by Sven Hedin, Noted Swedish Explorer&mdash;Authorized
Translation from, the Swedish<br />

<blockquote>

<p>This is one of the most remarkable narratives of the War. It is
a great historical record, as well as a fascinating story of personal
experiences. Dr. Sven Hedin is one of the great Swedish
explorers and historians. His record as a man of intrepid
daring is known throughout Europe. By special permission of
the Kaiser, Dr. Hedin was commissioned to visit and observe the
German Armies in Belgium and France. He is the friend of
Kings and was received with open arms at the headquarters of
the general staff of the German Army. These experiences he
describes in a volume entitled "With the German Armies in
the West," which is one of the few War books which has been
accepted by the German government as a true record. Dr.
Hedin's talks with the Kaiser, the Crown Prince, and the Army
Officers, with his journeys along the battle grounds of the
Western front, allow us to look behind the scenes for the first
time. A few selections from his remarkable tales are here given

<h3><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
I&mdash;"ON MY WAY TO WILHELMSTRASSE,
BERLIN"</h3>

<p>The rain falls thick and heavy and patters down on the
dripping lines outside my balcony. Berlin is dull and
miserable in the autumn when the rain sweeps its long,
monotonously straight streets with their heavy, dark
houses. Not even the trooping of the colors and the
march past at midday raise the drooping spirits, and only
a few pedestrians with open umbrellas join the band and
march in step with the soldiers. No calls are made, no
visits paid, for the whole of the aristocracy is in mourning
for lost relatives and everybody's thoughts are centered
on the war. Nobody feels inclined for the futile
pleasures of ordinary times when the newspapers speak
of a father who has lost four sons at the front, or of a
mother whose three sons have each died a hero's death
for Emperor and country. But no complaints are heard,
no tears seen. In the streets one seldom sees signs of
mourning. There is perhaps a tacit convention not to
express in black and white the sorrow which is felt at the
bottom of the heart, but to make the grief subservient to
the proud consciousness that the beloved one has fallen
for his country, never to return!...</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<p>But the rain keeps on falling and beats against the window-panes.
I hurry downstairs, jump into a taxi and in
a few minutes I am sitting in an elegant drawing-room
at the dainty new residence of the Swedish Minister, at
the corner of Friedrich Wilhelmstrasse and Tiergartenstrasse,
chatting with old friends&mdash;needless to say, about
the war. When I last met Count Taube in Berlin, I had
just returned from a long journey in the Far East. Now
I stood on the threshold of a new journey, which might
be infinitely longer than the last! Later in the day I
visited another nobleman, Prince von Wedel, whom I
had met in Vienna when he was ambassador there, and
in Strassburg when he was Governor. We had much
to talk about, but what is there to discuss in these days
but the great and bloody drama which occupies everyone's
thoughts&mdash;the War!</p>

<p>My most important visit in Berlin was to the Foreign
Office. But before narrating what took place there I
must say a few words about the reasons which led up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to my journey. It was desirable that no one in a responsible
position in Sweden should have an inkling of
my journey to the front. Our country belonged to the
neutral states, and thus no authority must entertain the
slightest shadow of suspicion that I was traveling on any
sort of secret mission. No,&mdash;the reason was a very simple
one. Only a few days' journey away the greatest war
of all time was being waged. It was clear that the outcome
of this struggle would decide the political development
for the next fifty or hundred years, or perhaps
longer. In any case its shadows must envelop the remainder
of the lives of the present generation....</p>

<p>Once this war is over, whole libraries of books will be
written about it. I do not think it an exaggeration to
say that on the western front alone upwards of a million
and a half diaries are being kept at the present moment.
In all directions, in all fighting units down to the company,
the platoon and the battery, official war journals
are being kept and accounts of the fighting are being
prepared from the bedrock furnished on the one hand
by the draft of outgoing reports and on the other by incoming
papers, orders, reports and communications. The
soldiers record their own personal experiences, the officers
their military observations. Many a notebook has no
doubt protected a heart or checked the death-dealing bullet.
Thus the sections of the German General Staff,
whose task it will be in due course to prepare the materials,
will be occupied for many years to come with
this monumental labor.</p>

<p>When I went out to the front, it was clearly established
in my mind that my narrative would be quite different
from the military accounts. I was not going to devote
any attention to matters of purely military science, which
could only be dealt with by experts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>


<h3>II&mdash;"I MEET HERR VON ZIMMERMANN"
</h3>
<p>I am standing on the doorstep and ringing the bell
at the Foreign Office at 76 Wilhelmstrasse, Berlin.</p>

<p>The Under Secretary of State, Herr von Zimmermann,
who is acting Foreign Minister in Berlin whilst
His Excellency von Jagow is at the Main Headquarters,
received me with open arms and said that all he knew
was that I was to proceed straightway to the said Headquarters.</p>

<p>"But where are the Main Headquarters?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That is a secret," Herr von Zimmermann answered,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Good, but how am I to get there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the Chief of the Great General Staff, Colonel-General
von Moltke, has given instructions that a car is
to be kept at your disposal. You may decide yourself
when you would like to start. An officer and an orderly
will accompany you, and if you like you can travel to
the Main Headquarters day and night without stopping,
or you can choose your own road and time. In fact, you
are at liberty to do as you like."</p>

<p>"And afterwards?"</p>

<p>"After that your fate will rest in the hands of His Excellency
von Moltke. No doubt he will map out a plan
for your journey. The only thing you have to think about
now is to get to him."</p>

<p>"And where shall I find the car?"</p>

<p>"This paper will tell you."</p>

<p>Herr von Zimmermann handed me a permit from the
Great General Staff which read as follows: "The bearer
of this permit is entitled to use the relays of the Imperial
Volunteer Automobile Corps to the Main Headquarters.
Everything that can in any way expedite his
journey is to be placed at his disposal."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>


<h3>III&mdash;"MY ARRIVAL AT THE GREAT GENERAL
STAFF IN LUXEMBURG"</h3>

<p>Still as ignorant regarding the whereabouts of the
Main Headquarters as when we left Berlin, we set out
from Treves in the morning of the 18th of September,
recrossed the Moselle, and cast a glance up at the heights
from which on August 4th Frenchmen in mufti were
heliographing to the airships, who wanted to know how
the German mobilization was getting on. At the flying
station we stopped a moment to have a look at the <i>Taubes</i>
in their canvas sheds....</p>

<p>Now we begin to look about. Yes, it is obvious that
the Main Headquarters are still at Luxemburg. Sentries
at the entrances to all hotels, soldiers everywhere,
officers rushing past in motor-cars. In a market-place
large tents have been put up for horses, and round them
walk the sentries smoking their pipes; in another open
space there are rows of motor-cars laden with petrol
and oil in cylinders.</p>

<p>We must observe becoming military precision in our
search and consequently make at once for the house where
the Great General Staff has taken up its quarters, and
which in ordinary times is a Luxemburg school. Von
Krum gets down and soon returns with the intimation that
we must report ourselves to a Lieutenant-Colonel
Hahnke. He sent us off to the Chief of the General
Staff, His Excellency von Moltke, who with his charming
Swedish Countess has just sat down to dinner at the
<i>Kölnischer Hof</i>, where they reside. The Countess was
on a short visit to Luxemburg in the service of the Red
Cross. Here I felt almost as if I were at home, for I
had many times been a guest in their hospitable home in
Berlin. As calm as if he had been on manoeuvers, the
Chief lit his cigar and made detailed enquiries about my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
plans and wishes. I said I wanted to go to the front
and see as much as I might be allowed to, mentioning
that it was my intention subsequently to describe what
I had seen of the war with my own eyes. If possible
I wanted to get an impression of a modern battle, and
hoped also to get an opportunity of visiting the occupied
parts of Belgium.</p>

<p>The Chief thought for a moment. Permission to visit
the front had already been granted to me by the Emperor,
and it only remained to decide which would be the
best place for me to begin my observations. The army
of the German Crown Prince was the nearest, only a
couple of hours away. The Chief would arrange everything
for my journey, and I was shortly to receive details
of the programme. "Of course, there can be no
question of safety in the fighting zone," he said, "it is not
far away. If you listen you can hear the thunder of
guns from Verdun."...</p>

<p>It would take too long to describe all the interesting
acquaintances I made in Luxemburg and to introduce to
the reader all the eminent men with whom I spoke during
the two days I spent in this little town. Suffice it to
mention the Imperial Chancellor von Bethmann Holweg,
the Foreign Minister von Jagow, the War Minister Lieutenant-General
von Falkenhayn, and the Chief of the
Imperial Volunteer Automobile Corps the young Prince
Waldemar, son of Prince Henry.</p>

<p>The Main Headquarters are the head or rather the
brain of the army in the field, where all plans are made
and from which all orders are issued. It is an incredibly
complicated apparatus with an organization of which
every detail has been prepared in advance. When an apparatus
of this kind is installed in a small town like
Luxemburg, all hotels, schools, barracks, Government
offices, as well as a number of private houses, have to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
requisitioned for billets. The invaded country has no
alternative but to resign itself to its fate. But nothing
is taken promiscuously, everything will be made good
after the war. The War Ministry is housed in an hotel,
the General Staff&mdash;as already mentioned&mdash;in a school,
the officers of the automobile corps, in a private house,
and so on. The Commander-in-Chief, von Moltke, resided
at the <i>Kölnischer Hof</i>, the Imperial Chancellor and
the Foreign Minister in an exceptionally elegant private
house, whilst the Emperor's personal staff and suite were
stopping at the <i>Hotel Staar</i>, where a room was also placed
at my disposal....</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;"AN INVITATION TO DINE WITH THE
EMPEROR"</h3>

<p>Directly I arrived in Luxemburg, I was honored with
an invitation to dine with the Emperor William the following
day at one o'clock. Most of the guests were
stopping at the <i>Hotel Staar</i>, and the cars were to leave
there in good time. I went with Adjutant-General, Lieutenant-General
von Gontard, Acting General à la suite.
The street close to the Imperial residence was railed off,
the barriers being withdrawn by the soldiers to let our
car pass. The Emperor lived in the house of the German
Minister and had his private apartments on the first floor.
On the ground floor was the chancellerie, where enormous
maps of the theaters of war were mounted on easels, and
next to it was the dining-room, quite a small apartment.</p>

<p>The guests, all in field uniform, without any display,
for-gathered in the chancellerie. I myself was dressed
in the most flagrant, everyday clothes&mdash;in the field nothing
is carried for show. Among the Emperor's suite I
recognized a couple of old acquaintances, the Headquarters
Commandant, Adjutant-General, Colonel-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
von Plessen, and the President of the Navy Council, Admiral
von Müller, of Swedish descent, who spoke Swedish
as fluently as German. The others were his Excellency
von Treutler and Lieutenant-General Baron
Marschall, Colonel von Mutius, acting aide-de-camp, the
Princes Pless and Arnim and the Emperor's body-physician,
Dr. Ilberg. We were thus ten all told.</p>


<h3>V&mdash;"THE DOOR OPENED ... EMPEROR
WILLIAM ENTERED"
</h3>
<p>At the stroke of one the door from the vestibule was
opened and Emperor William entered with a firm, quiet
step. All glances were fixed on the strongly built, well-knit
figure. The room became as quiet as the grave. One
realized that one was in the presence of a great personality.
The little room, otherwise so humble, now had a
deeper significance. Here was the axis, the pivot round
which the world's happenings turned. Here was the
center from which the war was directed. Germany is to
be crushed, so say its enemies. "<i>Magst ruhig sein</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
says the German army to its Fatherland. And here in
our midst stands its supreme war-lord, a picture of manliness,
resolution and honorable frankness. Around him
flit the thoughts and passions of the whole world. He
is the object of love, blind confidence and admiration, but
also of fear, hate and calumny. Round him, who loves
peace, rages the greatest war of all times, and his name
is ringed with strife....</p>

<p>Any feeling of timidity one may have had whilst waiting
for the most powerful and most remarkable man in
the world vanished completely once the Emperor, after
a more than hearty handshake and a cheery welcome,
began to speak. His voice is manly and military, he
speaks extraordinarily plainly without slurring over a
single syllable, he is never at a loss for a word, but always
strikes the nail on the head&mdash;often in exceedingly
forceful terms. He punctuates his sentences with quick
and expressive gestures. His speech flows smoothly,
is always terse and interesting and is often suddenly interrupted
by questions delivered with lightning precision,
which one must endeavor to answer equally quickly and
clearly. A good answer never fails to elicit the Emperor's
approval. He is exceedingly impulsive and his
conversation is a mixture of earnest and jest. A ready
repartee or an amusing tale causes him to laugh so heartily
that his shoulders shake with it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>At the Emperor's bidding we passed into the dining-room.
Admiral von Müller sat on the left, I on the right
of our august host, and opposite him was Adjutant-General
von Gontard. The table was simply laid. The only
luxury that could be discovered was a bell of gold placed
in front of the Emperor's cover, and which he rang when
a new course was to be brought in. The dinner was
equally plain, consisting of soup, meat with vegetables, a
sweet dish and fruit with claret. I have seldom been as
hungry as when I rose from this table: not on account
of the dishes, but because there had not been a moment's
silence up to the time when the bell rang for the last
time and bade the uniformed servants withdraw our
chairs as we rose. The Emperor talked to me all the
time. He began by reminding me of my last lecture in
Berlin, at which he was present, and he conjectured that
Tibet, where I had passed through such stirring times,
would probably soon be the only country in the world
where peace reigned. Then we spoke of the political
position and of the storms that are sweeping over Europe....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>On a table in the chancellerie were cigars and cigarettes
round a lighted candle. Here the conversation was
continued with zest and vigor, and jest and earnest, horrors
of war and funny stories were all jumbled together;
finally the Emperor took his leave, wishing me a successful
and instructive trip, and went up to his apartments,
where no doubt piles of papers and letters, reports
and telegrams awaited him.</p>

<p>The talk of the Emperor having aged during the war,
and of the war with all its labors and anxieties having
sapped his strength and health, is all nonsense. His hair
is no more pronouncedly iron gray than before the war,
his face has color, and far from being worn and thin,
he is plump and strong, bursting with energy and rude
health. A man of Emperor William's stamp is in his
element when, through the force of circumstances, he is
compelled to stake all he possesses and above all himself
for the good and glory of his country.</p>


<h3>VI&mdash;"I GO TO SEE THE CROWN PRINCE"</h3>

<p>I returned to the <i>Hotel Staar</i> just in time to meet the
young lieutenant who had been instructed by General
Moltke to take me to the Headquarters of the Crown
Prince's Army. His name was Hans von Gwinner and
he is the son of the great banker and Bagdad Railway
magnate in Berlin. He was a wide-awake and capable
young fellow and drove his car himself. I sat down beside
him, whilst the orderly accompanying us took his
seat inside.</p>

<p>It poured with rain as we left the town. The road
was slippery, but we had studded tires and the lieutenant
drove at terrific speed. We had started off rather late
and we wanted to get in before dark. It is better thus,
otherwise one is not entirely safe from the attentions of
<i>franctireurs</i>. A whole lot of them had recently been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
caught by the Fifth Army and shot without hesitation....</p>

<p>We stop outside the house in which the General in
Command of the 5th Army has taken up his quarters.
I was able to speak there without difficulty to one of my
friends from the Main Headquarters, Landrat Baron von
Maltzahn, Member of the Reichstag and a personal friend
of the Crown Prince. He was able to give me the welcome
news that I was expected and that I must hurry in
order to be in time for supper, which was served at eight
o'clock. So we drove at once up to the little French
château, where His I. &amp; R. Highness had elected to stay.
Here I said good-bye to my excellent friend Lieutenant
von Gwinner and thanked him for his companionship.
Thus he, too, disappears from my horizon, and I stand
before a new association of acquaintances and friendships.</p>

<p>Footmen in military uniforms at once took charge of
my baggage and conducted me to my room on the first
floor, next door to the Crown Prince's private apartments.
A few minutes before eight the acting Lord-in-Waiting,
Court-Marshal von Behr, knocked at my door.
He was a pleasant young man of distinguished and attractive
appearance, and he had come to bring me in to
supper. We went out through the upper vestibule and
down the stairs, from the landing of which we were fortunate
enough to witness a pleasing ceremony. In the
lower hall stood a number of officers in line, and opposite
them some twenty soldiers formed up in the same way.
Then came the Crown Prince William, tall, slim and
royally straight, dressed in a dazzling white tunic and
wearing the Iron Cross of the first and second class; he
walked with a firm step between the lines of soldiers.
An adjutant followed him, carrying in a casket a number
of Iron Crosses. The Crown Prince took one and handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
it to the nearest officer, whom he thanked for the services
which he had rendered to his Emperor and country, and
then with a hearty handshake he congratulated the hero
whom he had thus honored.</p>

<p>When all the officers had received their decorations,
the reward for their bravery, the turn came of the soldiers,
the ceremony being precisely the same as with the
officers; but I found it hard to distinguish what the soldiers
said in their loud, rough and nervous voices. At
last I distinguished the words: <i>Danke untertänigst Kaiserliche
Hoheit</i> (I humbly thank your Imperial Highness).</p>


<h3>VII&mdash;"AT SUPPER WITH THE CROWN PRINCE"</h3>

<p>When the knights of the Iron Cross had taken their
departure, we went down into the hall, where the Crown
Prince stepped up to me and bade me heartily welcome
to his Headquarters and to the seat of war. The meal,
which might as well have been called dinner as supper,
was attended by the following gentlemen: Lieutenant-General
Schmidt von Knobelsdorff, Chief of Staff of the
5th Army, Court-Marshal von Behr, Chief of the Medical
Corps, Body-Physician Professor Widenmann, Majors
von der Planitz, von Müller, personal Adjutant to H.I.
&amp; R.H., and Heymann, Lieutenant von Zobeltitz and a
few members of the Staff, who arrived later after the
day's work in the field and took their seats at the lower
end of the table.</p>

<p>Would you like to know what the German Crown
Prince, the Crown Prince of Prussia, eats for supper?
Here is the menu: cabbage soup, boiled beef with horseradish
and potatoes, wild duck with salad, fruit, wine,
and coffee with cigars. And what would you say the
conversation was about? It is hard to say exactly, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
we traveled over almost the whole world with the ease
bred by familiarity. The Crown Prince, like the Emperor,
began with Tibet, and from there it was but a
step across the Himalayas to the palms of the Hugli
Delta, the pagodas of Benares, the silver moonlight over
Taj Mahal, the tigers of the jungle and the music of the
crystal waves of India beating against the rocks of Malabar
point. We also spoke of old unforgettable memories
and of common friends who now love us no longer&mdash;of
the brave and famous Kitchener, the conqueror of Omdurman
and South Africa, of the Maharajahs and their
fairy-like splendor at Bikanir, Kutch Behar, Gwalior,
Kashmir and Idar.</p>

<p>We also talked about the war and its horrors, and the
terrible sacrifices it demands. "But it cannot be helped,"
said the Crown Prince, "our Fatherland asks us to give
all we have, and <i>we will, we must</i> win, even if the whole
world takes up arms against us."</p>

<p>"Is not the calm here wonderful! We seem to be living
to-night in the most absolute peace, and yet it is but a
couple of hours' drive to the firing line," observes my
Imperial host after listening to a short, concise and satisfactory
report made in a ringing voice by an officer who
has just entered. "Yes, your Imperial Highness, I had
imagined the Staff Headquarters of an army to resemble
a buzzing beehive, but now that I have the reality before
me, I find no trace of anxiety or nervousness, nothing
but calm and assurance everywhere. But what I should
like to see most of all would be a battle, for I suspect that
in common with most other civilians I have formed an
erroneous opinion on this subject."</p>

<p>The Crown Prince smiles and answers: "Yes, battle
painters like Neuville and Détaille would have little use
for their art in these days. Of the fighting men one sees
practically nothing, for they are concealed by the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and in the trenches, and it is rather dangerous to get too
close to a bayonet charge&mdash;unless one's duty takes one
there."</p>

<p>What life and spirit at the Crown Prince's Headquarters!
Everything was gay with the freshness of youth,
and devoid of restraint. No trace of the stiffness of
court ceremonial. Even General Schmidt, who usually
maintained the strictest discipline, was infected by the
prevailing spirit of camaradie. But owing to the terrible
burden of work which rested on the shoulders of the
Chief of Staff, it was not unusual for him to come in for
his meals after the others. The supper, or rather the
talk after it, went on till about eleven&mdash;these were the
only hours when one could meet in quiet, for during the
day everyone was busy with his duties, and the Crown
Prince then occupied his post as commanding officer at
suitable points at the front.</p>

<p>The château where we were staying belonged to an
aristocratic French lady&mdash;if I remember rightly her name
was du Vernier. When the war broke out she moved to
Bordeaux. On her return after the contest she will find
her château, her estates and the beautiful park in the
same condition as when she went away. There was a
certain aristocratic grandeur about the château, though
signs of decay were already making themselves apparent.
On the mantelpiece in my room stood a pendulum
clock of gilt bronze of an antique mythological design, and
on each side stood a couple of gorgeous candelabra. The
walls were decorated with a few unassuming pictures,
amongst them a portrait of an old French warrior.</p>

<p>I open my window, it is pitch-dark outside, and the
rain falls close and heavy upon the trees and lawns outside.
Tired after a somewhat ambitious day's work, I
hurry to bed, the more so as I suspect the next day's
programme to be no less exacting....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<h3>VIII&mdash;WITH THE GERMAN SOLDIERS&mdash;"TO
VICTORY OR DEATH"</h3>

<p>But events move all too fast. Observations and impressions
follow so quickly upon one another that it is
difficult to assimilate them all. The whole road is full of
supply columns moving southward, and we meet innumerable
empty transport lorries on the way north, to
be reloaded at some railway station. Here we also see
fresh young troops, all strapping fellows, who have come
direct from Germany to go straight to victory or death.
All are jolly and eager; truly, they look as if the whole
affair were to them but an autumn man&oelig;uver, and as
if they felt no trace of excitement. They march along
with easy bearing and sing merry soldiers' ditties under
the leaden skies now darkening this unhappy, bleeding
France. They light their pipes and their eternal cigarettes,
laugh and chat&mdash;as if they were going to a picnic
in the country. In reality they are going out to fill the
gaps made by the French fire in the ranks of their comrades.
They are <i>Ersatstruppen</i>, i.e., reinforcements, but
I do not see a single face which betrays the slightest feeling
that death is near. They hear the thunder of the
guns better than we do, for the humming of the car
drowns all other sounds. But they seem to delight in the
dull music, and yet their place is far in advance of the
artillery positions. <i>Ersatstruppen!</i> it means that their
duty is to <i>replace</i> the fallen, and that the same fate awaits
themselves. Yet they are gay and happy. "<i>Dulce et decorum
est pro patria mori.</i>"...</p>

<p>We now begin to notice that we are approaching the
firing line. The whole road is encumbered with troops.
Here comes a detachment of wounded on foot, with
bandages round heads and hands, or with the arm in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
sling. We meet an empty ammunition column, an endless
string of rattling wagons.</p>

<p>The artillery ammunition column which we are just
now passing is an impressive sight. The noise of these
vehicles, dull and heavy, is quite different from that of
the empty wagons on our left, but then they are loaded
to the top with heavy ammunition, shells for 21-cm.
mortars at Septsarges and neighbouring villages. Every
ammunition wagon&mdash;consisting of limber and wagon
body&mdash;with its team of six horses requires the services
of six men. Three of them&mdash;drivers&mdash;ride on the off-side
horses, two are seated on the limber, and one facing
the rear on the wagon body. They are armed with
Mauser pistols fastened on the left side of the belt, but
the swords of the drivers are securely strapped on to the
left side of the saddle.</p>

<p>The horses are fat and sleek, and pull without exerting
themselves unduly. They move at a walking pace&mdash;anything
else would be impossible on this road. It is a
far finer sight to see one of these columns trundling along
at full speed with the horses moving at a sharp trot or
gallop. Even at the pace at which they are now travelling
these endless columns are an impressive and attractive
sight. What does it matter if the helmets, in order
not to glitter and attract attention, are concealed by a
cover which even hides the spike surmounting them;
what does it matter if the men's uniforms are of the same
dirty grey as the clay and mud of the soil? The whole
team looks picturesque enough with its massive, solid
wagon, its pole, its leather fittings and its harness.</p>

<p>Tramp, tramp go the horses' hoofs, and behind them
comes the rattling of the heavy wagons. One rider sings,
another whistles and a third is shouting at a refractory
horse. Behind sit a couple of men rolling cigarettes,
which by the way is more difficult than it sounds when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
wagon is jolting up and down. This column also has a
mounted escort. The train is wound up by a field kitchen
with a couple of store wagons on which a few bundles
of firewood are also lying. Without ceasing, this eternal
tramp, tramp, keeps dinning into our ears as the columns
slowly travel southward, a never-ending stream of warriors,
horses, ammunition and provisions.</p>


<h3>IX&mdash;"WE DROVE THROUGH A ROARING SEA
OF LOUD HURRAHS"</h3>

<p>It was still daylight when we returned to our domicile,
where the Crown Prince, just back from his day's work,
was resting in the doorway. A moment later I went out
for a walk in the town. At the bridges over the Meuse
I was stopped by the sentries, who in authoritative but
invariably polite tones asked to see my <i>Ausweis</i>. That
they found me suspicious-looking, ambling along as I
did with a sketch-book under my arm, was not to be
wondered at. Only one of them, an honest Landwehr
man, declared categorically that my pass was not sufficient.
"Oh," I said. "The name of the Chief of the
General Staff of the Field Army, General Moltke, does
not impress you?" "No, the permit must be viséd by the
5th Army," he replied. A couple of his comrades saved
the situation after reading the permit, and declared that
General Moltke was good enough for them....</p>

<p>It had been arranged that at about half-past six I
should look out for the Crown Prince and his staff as they
passed through Dun on their way back from Romagne.
The time was approaching, and we were on the watch.
The traffic had not decreased at all, rather the reverse.
For a moment it looked like a block, and it would have
been a nice thing if the Crown Prince had arrived just
then. We crossed the bridge and were outside the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
when the aristocratic-looking cars, bearing the mark,
<i>General Ober Kommando V. Armee</i>, came tearing along
at full speed. Beside the chauffeur of the first one sat
the Crown Prince himself in a cloak with a high collar.
He made a sign to me to get in and I took my seat behind
him. Then he talked for a while to the officers of the
lines of communications, and after that we started. But
now the pace was slow, as we happened to meet an infantry
regiment. The men took hold of their helmets by
the spike, raised them aloft and gave a rousing cheer, as
if they were charging a French position. But this time
the cheer was meant for the Commander of the 5th Army
and the heir to the throne, and we drove through a roaring
sea of loud hurrahs. Gradually the ranks thinned
out and finally came the stragglers&mdash;for there are footsore
men even in the best marching army of all&mdash;in small
groups of two or three, but they cheered as wildly as
the rest. Last of all a solitary man stood by the side of
the road. He, too, joined in with all the strength of his
lungs. When the Crown Prince had reassumed his motor
goggles and turned up the collar of his cloak he was not
easily recognised, especially by the men of the transport
columns we met, who had their horses to look after.
But his Imperial and Royal Highness turned half round
to me and said unassumingly that nothing pleased him
more than to find that he was supported and understood
by the soldiers. He considered it the first duty of
a prince to show himself worthy of the confidence of his
whole people, and for his own part he could not imagine
a greater happiness than to occupy such a position in the
minds of the German people.</p>


<h3>X&mdash;"AT DINNER WITH THE CROWN PRINCE"</h3>

<p>We reached home in due course and sat down to table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
The spirits of the company were as cheerful and unconstrained
as usual, though one would have expected high-sounding
speeches, toasts and cheering.</p>

<p>Dinner had been going on for some time when Professor
Widenmann, the body-physician, came in and took
his place. He had been at a hospital, looking after our
friend, Baron von Maltzahn, who had been the victim of
a motor accident in the course of the day. The car, while
going at a terrific pace, had skidded at a corner of the
wet road and turned over. Von Maltzahn lay underneath
and had the whole weight of the car on his chest.
He had a couple of ribs broken, a broken leg, concussion
of the brain and general shock. His condition was rather
alarming, but the professor had good hopes of his recovery.</p>

<p>That professor is a man one would never forget. We
took to each other, more especially as he had travelled
all over the world. He had seen a great deal of Africa,
and had been very near the summit of Kilima Njaro
when he was forced to turn back by wind and weather.
We had mutual friends far and near, and long after the
others had gone to their rooms we sat up chatting&mdash;on
that evening, which was my last with the German Crown
Prince, the Crown Prince of Prussia.</p>

<p>On the following day, September 24, we made a very
early breakfast, after which the cars of the Chief Command
of the Army again drove up to the château. I
thanked his Imperial and Royal Highness the Crown
Prince with all my heart for the great hospitality which
had been shown me and for all the memorable things I
had had the opportunity of seeing while with his proud
army. After a vigourous shake of the hand and a friendly
<i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i> the energetic young Imperial Prince
got into his car and went off to his duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>


<h3>XI&mdash;"I WAS ONCE MORE AT THE EMPEROR'S
TABLE"</h3>

<p>I was once more honoured with an invitation to dine
at the Emperor's table at one o'clock. Those present,
apart from the Chamberlain, included Herren von
Plessen, von Gontard and von Busch, the latter being the
German Minister at Luxemburg, also the Emperor's
Field Chaplain and a couple of adjutants. In the forenoon
news had been received of the illness of Prince
Oskar. He had contracted some sort of heart complaint
through over-exertion. I expected therefore to find the
Emperor a bit depressed, but there was no sign of it. He
walked in with youthful and military bearing, honoured
me once more with a hearty handshake and bade me
welcome back from the 5th Army. Thereupon he took
a letter out of his pocket and asked me to read it through
carefully. Whilst His Majesty was talking to his suite,
I read the letter. It was addressed to the Emperor personally
and was written by a sergeant who had been at
Prince Joachim's side when he was wounded. Now the
sergeant wanted to tell his august master how gallantly
the Prince had borne himself and what an example he
had been to the soldiers. The letter was simply and
ingenuously written and showed how deep and strong is
the loyalty which binds the German Army to its supreme
Chief and Emperor. The loyalty and unity between
Emperor and people, between Commander and Army,
form the firm and immovable rock on which the German
Empire has been built up. When the Emperor turned
to me again and asked what I thought of the letter, I
merely answered: "It must be a pleasure to your Majesty
to receive such messages from the rank and file."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "There is nothing that gives me so
much pleasure as these proofs of the faithful loyalty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
my people and the close bonds which bind me to my
entire army. Such a letter as this I treasure amongst
my most valued possessions."</p>

<p>Then we talked about Prince Oskar's illness, and whilst
on this topic, the Emperor said: "So you see, now
Hohenzollern blood, too, has flowed. I have six sons and
a nephew with me in the war and among the many
German Princes who are fighting at the front several
have already given their lives for Germany's sake."</p>


<h3>XII&mdash;"SUPPER WITH CROWN PRINCE OF
BAVARIA"</h3>

<p>We were to drive to Douai, where we were invited to
take supper at 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> with the ... Crown Prince of
Bavaria. The distance is nearly thirty-four kilometres
and can easily be covered in three-quarters of an hour,
but the numerous posts stationed on the road took up
much of our time. It was five minutes to eight when
we arrived. An adjutant conducted us to a drawing-room,
and we had not waited half a minute when the
Crown Prince entered.</p>

<p>He is one of those rare men whom all love and admire&mdash;all
except the English, for I think that even the French
cannot help paying him a meed of respect. In the
German army he is looked upon as a very eminent general&mdash;a
born strategist and a thoroughly schooled soldier.
As regards appearance, manner and speech, he is fascinating
and congenial in the highest degree, neither regal
nor humble, but without artifice and modest like an ordinary
mortal. When one <i>knows</i> that he has recently
experienced the greatest private sorrow which could befall
him, one fancies, perhaps, that one detects a trace
thereof in his features&mdash;an air of sadness&mdash;but otherwise
he does not betray, by a look or a sigh, how deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
he grieves over the death of the little prince of thirteen,
the darling of all Bavaria. When the country and the
empire are in danger, all private sorrows must be put
aside! The Crown Prince has no time to grieve or to
think of the void and bereavement which he will feel on
his victorious return to Munich. He lives for and with
his army, and is like a father to each and all of his
soldiers. He devotes all his power of mind, all his physical
strength, all his time, to the one great object which
dominates all else in the minds of the whole German
army.</p>

<p>Crown Prince Rupprecht walks in with brisk and easy
stride, stretches out his hands towards us and gives us a
truly cordial welcome. And then he adds half-humourously:
"I expect some other distinguished guests at my
table to-night."</p>

<p>"Who can that be?" asks the Duke.</p>

<p>"The Emperor!" replies the Crown Prince, and clasps
his hands together.</p>

<p>"The Emperor?" we cry, for we had no idea that His
Majesty was in this part of the country.</p>

<p>"Yes, the Emperor has visited several units in this
neighbourhood to-day, and has promised ... Hush, I
hear his car!" and with that the Crown Prince hurried
out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Officers of the General Staff of the
Army came to greet us, and presently the Emperor's
suite, among whom I knew several, also entered. Before
I had time to wonder where the supreme War-Lord himself
had gone, we were asked to step into the dining-room.
The Emperor was already seated at the table.
We all stepped up to our chairs, but no one seated himself.
The Emperor sat with bowed head, looking very
grave. But suddenly his blue eyes flashed up, and he
nodded kindly in all directions. When he caught sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of me, he extended his hand across the table and cried
gaily: "<i>Guten Tag, mein lieber Sven Hedin; es scheint
Ihnen gut zu gefallen in meiner Armee</i>," a sentiment
which I confirmed with the greatest alacrity.</p>

<p>Perhaps it might amuse the reader to hear who were
the ten people seated round Crown Prince Rupprecht's
table. Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg sat at the
Emperor's right, and Prince Löwenstein at his left.
Right opposite the Emperor sat the Crown Prince&mdash;the
host&mdash;with Colonel-General von Plessen, Adjutant-General,
at his right and myself at his left. Next to me on
the other side was Lieut.-General von Marschall, with
Colonel Tappen, of the Crown Prince's staff, on his left.
To the left of Prince Löwenstein sat General Falkenhayn,
Minister of War, and between him and General von
Plessen the chief of the Crown Prince's staff, General
Krafft von Dellmensingen. At another table of about
the same size, covers had been laid for the other gentlemen
of the Emperor's and Crown Prince's staff and
suite.</p>


<h3>XIII&mdash;"THE WAR LORD IN JOLLY SPIRITS"</h3>

<p>The Emperor was in brilliant spirits. I really do not
know whether he <i>can</i> be otherwise, for whenever I have
had the honour to meet him, he has always been merry,
amiable and witty. He can certainly express at times in
words of thunder his displeasure at some contemptible
act on the part of the enemy, but he is soon sunshine
again and bursts into irresistible laughter at some whimsical
idea. He has a wonderful gift of instilling life into
a party and keeping the conversation at high pitch&mdash;as
he did here for over two and a half hours. He told us
a great deal of most interesting news, things which had
happened in different parts of the field during the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
few days and which, at least to me and to the Duke, were
news indeed. If one asks the Emperor any question
about the conditions in more or less remote countries, as
to which sparse or contradictory information has come
to one's ears, he will, off-hand, and with a masterly marshalling
of facts, deliver a veritable lecture on its internal
and external policy, its public sentiments, its resources,
and its military strength. I think I have never met a
man who can rival Emperor William in this respect.</p>

<p>He also possesses the faculty of grasping with lightning
quickness and judging the opinions expressed by
others. He listened with the liveliest interest to Crown
Prince Rupprecht as the latter gave him various details
about his army, and to me when I described the bombardment
of Ostend.</p>

<p>It was past half-past ten when the Emperor laid down
his cigar and rose to say good-bye with that vigorous
handshake which leaves its mark on one's knuckles.
The Crown Prince alone accompanied him out into the
hall, which immediately adjoined the dining-room and
from which a few steps led out into the road. A soldier
stood ready holding the Emperor's light greyish-blue
cloak, with dark fur collar; another handed him the plain
Prussian officer's field-cap. After the host and his guest
had exchanged a few more words they went out to the
car, which drove off rapidly into the night.</p>

<h2>"THE FIRST HUNDRED THOUSAND"&mdash;WITH
KITCHENER'S ARMY
IN FRANCE</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Stories Straight from the Trenches</i><br /><br />
<i>Told by Captain Ian Hay Beith, Famous Scotch
Novelist with the Argyil and Sutherland
Highlanders</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>Ian Hay's collection of War stories is pronounced in England
"the greatest book of the War." This Scotch novelist went to
the trenches to fight with the Highlanders. He sends "back
home" graphic and absorbing stories of a thousand heroes.
They are full of humor, with bits of superb character drawing
that make the men at the front seem like old friends. His
division has been badly cut up and seriously reduced in numbers
during the War; he has risen from a sub-lieutenant to the
rank of Captain, finally to be transferred to the machine gun
division and recommended for a military cross. The story of
the first hundred thousand was originally contributed in the
form of an anonymous narrative to <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>. In
a letter to his publishers, Capt. Beith describes the circumstances
under which he is writing: "I write this from the
stone floor of an outhouse, where the pigmeal is first accumulated
and then boiled up at a particularly smelly French farm,
which is saying a good deal. It is a most interesting life and
if I come through the present unpleasantness I shall have
enough copy to last me twenty years." His pictures of the
Great Struggle, uniquely rich in graphic human detail, have
been collected into a volume, "The First Hundred Thousand,"
by <i>Houghton, Mifflin and Company</i>, of Boston and New York,
which is creating wide attention. One of the stories entitled,
"The Front of the Front," is here retold by permission of his
publishers.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
I&mdash;THE FRONT OF THE FRONT</h3>

<p>We took over these trenches a few days ago; and as
the Germans are barely two hundred yards away, this
chapter seems to justify its title.... We find that
we are committed to an indefinite period of trench life,
like every one else.</p>

<p>Certainly we are starting at the bottom of the ladder.
These trenches are badly sited, badly constructed, difficult
of access from the rear, and swarming with large,
fat, unpleasant flies, of the bluebottle variety. They go
to sleep, chiefly upon the ceiling of one's dugout, during
the short hours of darkness, but for twenty hours out
of twenty-four they are very busy indeed. They divide
their attentions between stray carrion&mdash;there is a good
deal hereabout&mdash;and our rations. If you sit still for five
minutes they also settle upon <i>you</i>, like pins in a pincushion.
Then, when face, hands, and knees can endure
no more, and the inevitable convulsive wriggle occurs,
they rise in a vociferous swarm, only to settle again when
the victim becomes quiescent. To these, high-explosives
are a welcome relief.</p>

<p>The trenches themselves are no garden city, like those
at Armentières. They were sited and dug in the dark,
not many weeks ago, to secure two hundred yards of
French territory recovered from the Boche by bomb and
bayonet. (The captured trench lies behind us now, and
serves as our second line.) They are muddy&mdash;you come
to water at three feet&mdash;and at one end, owing to their
concave formation, are open to enfilade. The parapet
in many places is too low. If you make it higher with
sandbags you offer the enemy a comfortable target: if
you deepen the trench you turn it into a running stream.
Therefore long-legged subalterns crawl painfully past
these danger-spots on all-fours, envying Little Tich.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<h3>II&mdash;STORY OF ZACCHAEUS: "HE LIVES UP A
TREE"</h3>

<p>Then there is Zacchæus. We call him by this name
because he lives up a tree. There is a row of pollarded
willows standing parallel to our front, a hundred and fifty
yards away. Up, or in, one of these lives Zacchæus. We
have never seen him, but we know he is there; because
if you look over the top of the parapet he shoots you
through the head. We do not even know which of the
trees he lives in. There are nine of them, and every
morning we comb them out, one by one, with a machine-gun.
But all in vain. Zacchæus merely crawls away into
the standing corn behind his trees, and waits till we have
finished. Then he comes back and tries to shoot the
machine-gun officer. He has not succeeded yet, but he
sticks to his task with gentle persistence. He is evidently
of a persevering rather than vindictive disposition.</p>

<p>Then there is Unter den Linden. This celebrated
thoroughfare is an old communication-trench. It runs,
half-ruined, from the old German trench in our rear,
right through our own front line, to the present German
trenches. It constitutes such a bogey as the Channel
Tunnel scheme once was: each side sits jealously at its
own end, anticipating hostile enterprises from the other.
It is also the residence of "Minnie." But we will return
to Minnie later.</p>

<p>The artillery of both sides, too, contributes its mite.
There is a dull roar far in the rear of the German
trenches, followed by a whirring squeak overhead. Then
comes an earth-shaking crash a mile behind us. We whip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
round, and there, in the failing evening light, against the
sunset, there springs up the silhouette of a mighty tree
in full foliage. Presently the silhouette disperses, drifts
away, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"The coals is hame, right enough!" comments Private
Tosh.</p>

<p>Instantly our guns reply, and we become the humble
spectators of an artillery duel. Of course, if the enemy
gets tired of "searching" the countryside for our guns and
takes to "searching" our trenches instead, we lose all interest
in the proceedings, and retire to our dugouts, hoping
that no direct hits will come our way.</p>

<p>But guns are notoriously erratic in their time-tables,
and fickle in their attentions. It is upon Zacchæus and
Unter den Linden&mdash;including Minnie&mdash;that we mainly
rely for excitement.</p>


<h3>III&mdash;STORY OF AYLING OF THE MACHINE
GUNNERS</h3>

<p>As already recorded, we took over these trenches a
few days ago, in the small hours of the morning. In the
ordinary course of events, relieving parties are usually
able to march up under cover of darkness to the reserve
trench, half a mile in rear of the firing line, and so proceed
to their appointed place. But on this occasion the
German artillery happened to be "distributing coal"
among the billets behind. This made it necessary to
approach our new home by tortuous ways, and to take
to subterranean courses at a very early stage of the
journey. For more than two hours we toiled along a
trench just wide enough to permit a man to wear his
equipment, sometimes bent double to avoid the bullets of
snipers, sometimes knee-deep in glutinous mud.</p>

<p>Ayling, leading a machine-gun section who were burdened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
with their weapons and seven thousand rounds of
ammunition, mopped his steaming brow and inquired
of his guide how much farther there was to go.</p>

<p>"Abart two miles, sir," replied the youth with gloomy
satisfaction. He was a private of the Cockney regiment
whom we were relieving; and after the manner of his
kind, would infinitely have preferred to conduct us down
half a mile of a shell-swept road, leading straight to the
heart of things, than waste time upon an uninteresting but
safe <i>détour</i>.</p>

<p>At this Ayling's Number One, who was carrying a
machine-gun tripod weighing forty-eight pounds, said
something&mdash;something distressingly audible&mdash;and groaned
deeply.</p>

<p>"If we'd come the way I wanted," continued the guide,
much pleased with the effect of his words upon his audience,
"we'd a' been there by now. But the Adjutant, 'e
says to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If we had come the way you wanted," interrupted
Ayling brutally, "we should probably have been in Kingdom
Come by now. Hurry up!" Ayling, in common
with the rest of those present, was not in the best of tempers,
and the loquacity of the guide had been jarring upon
him for some time.</p>

<p>The Cockney private, with the air of a deeply-wronged
man, sulkily led on, followed by the dolorous procession.
Another ten minutes' labored progress brought them to
a place where several ways met.</p>

<p>"This is the beginning of the reserve trenches, sir,"
announced the guide. "If we'd come the way I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lead on!" said Ayling, and his perspiring followers
murmured threatening applause.</p>

<p>The guide, now in his own territory, selected the muddiest
opening and plunged down it. For two hundred
yards or so he continued serenely upon his way, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the air of one exhibiting the metropolis to a party of
country cousins. He passed numerous turnings. Then,
once or twice, he paused irresolutely; then moved on.
Finally he halted, and proceeded to climb out of the
trench.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" demanded Ayling suspiciously.</p>

<p>"We got to cut across the open 'ere, sir," said the
youth glibly. "Trench don't go no farther. Keep as
low as you can."</p>

<p>With resigned grunts the weary pilgrims hoisted themselves
and their numerous burdens out of their slimy
thoroughfare, and followed their conductor through the
long grass in single file, feeling painfully conspicuous
against the whitening sky. Presently they discovered,
and descended into, another trench&mdash;all but the man with
the tripod, who descended into it before he discovered it&mdash;and
proceeded upon their dolorous way. Once more
the guide, who had been refreshingly but ominously silent
for some time, paused irresolutely.</p>

<p>"Look here, my man," said Ayling, "do you, or do you
not, know where you are?"</p>

<p>The paragon replied hesitatingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if we'd come by the way I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ayling took a deep breath, and though conscious of
the presence of formidable competitors, was about to
make the best of an officer's vocabulary, when a kilted
figure loomed out of the darkness.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Who are you?" inquired Ayling.</p>

<p>"This iss the Camerons' trenches, sirr," replied a polite
West Highland voice. "What trenches wass you
seeking?"</p>

<p>Ayeling told him.</p>

<p>"They are behind you, sirr."</p>

<p>"I was just goin' to say, sir," chanted the guide, making
one last effort to redeem his prestige, "as 'ow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Party," commanded Ayling, "about turn!"</p>

<p>Having received details of the route from the friendly
Cameron, he scrambled out of the trench and crawled
along to what was now the head of the procession. A
plaintive voice followed him.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir, where shall <i>I</i> go now?"</p>

<p>Ayling answered the question explicitly, and moved
off, feeling much better. The late conductor of the party
trailed disconsolately in the rear.</p>

<p>"I should like to know wot I'm 'ere for," he murmured
indignantly.</p>

<p>He got his answer, like a lightning-flash.</p>

<p>"For tae carry <i>this</i>," said the man with the tripod,
turning round. "Here, caatch!"</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;A DAY'S WORK IN THE TRENCHES</h3>

<p>The day's work in trenches begins about nine o'clock
the night before. Darkness having fallen, various parties
steal out into the No-Man's-Land beyond the parapet.
There are numerous things to be done. The barbed wire
has been broken up by shrapnel, and must be repaired.
The whole position in front of the wire must be patrolled,
to prevent the enemy from creeping forward in the
dark. The corn has grown to an uncomfortable height
in places, so a fatigue party is told off to cut it&mdash;surely
the strangest species of harvesting that the annals of
agriculture can record. On the left front the muffled
clinking of picks and shovels announces that a "sap" is
in course of construction: those incorrigible night-birds,
the Royal Engineers, are making it for the machine-gunners,
who in the fullness of time will convey their voluble
weapon to its forward extremity, and "loose off a belt or
two" in the direction of a rather dangerous hollow midway
between the trenches, from which of late mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
sounds of digging and guttural talking have been detected
by the officer who lies in the listening-post, in
front of our barbed-wire entanglement, drawing secrets
from the bowels of the earth by means of a microphone.</p>

<p>Behind the firing trench even greater activity prevails.
Damage done to the parapet by shell fire is being
repaired. Positions and emplacements are being constantly
improved, communication trenches widened or
made more secure. Down these trenches fatigue parties
are filing, to draw rations and water and ammunition
from the limbered wagons which are waiting in the
shadow of a wood, perhaps a mile back. It is at this
hour, too, that the wounded, who have been lying pathetically
cheerful and patient in the dressing-station in the
reserve trench, are smuggled to the Field Ambulance&mdash;probably
to find themselves safe in a London hospital
within twenty-four hours. Lastly, under the kindly
cloak of night, we bury our dead.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, within various stifling dugouts, in the
firing trench or support trench, overheated company commanders
are dictating reports or filling in returns. (Even
now the Round Game Department is not entirely shaken
off.) There is the casualty return, and a report on the
doings of the enemy, and another report of one's own
doings, and a report on the direction of the wind, and
so on. Then there are various indents to fill up&mdash;scrawled
on a wobbly writing-block with a blunt indelible pencil
by the light of a guttering candle&mdash;for ammunition, and
sandbags, and revetting material.</p>

<p>All this literature has to be sent to Battalion Headquarters
by one <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, either by orderly or telephone.
There it is collated and condensed, and forwarded to the
Brigade, which submits it to the same process and sends
it on, to be served up piping hot and easily digestible at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the breakfast-table of the Division, five miles away, at
eight o'clock.</p>


<h3>V&mdash;SOLDIERS' NIGHT AT THE FRONT</h3>

<p>You must not imagine, however, that all this nightwork
is performed in gross darkness. On the contrary.
There is abundance of illumination; and by a pretty
thought, each side illuminates the other. We perform
our nocturnal tasks, in front of and behind the firing
trench, amid a perfect hail of star-shells and magnesium
lights, topped up at times by a searchlight&mdash;all supplied
by our obliging friend the Hun. We, on our part, do
our best to return these graceful compliments.</p>

<p>The curious and uncanny part of it all is that there
is no firing. During these brief hours there exists an
informal truce, founded on the principle of live and let
live. It would be an easy business to wipe out that
working-party, over there by the barbed wire, with a
machine-gun. It would be child's play to shell the road
behind the enemy's trenches, crowded as it must be with
ration-wagons and water-carts, into a blood-stained wilderness.
But so long as each side confines itself to purely
defensive and recuperative work, there is little or no interference.
That slave of duty, Zacchæus, keeps on pegging
away; and occasionally, if a hostile patrol shows itself
too boldly, there is a little exuberance from a machine-gun;
but on the whole there is silence. After all,
if you prevent your enemy from drawing his rations, his
remedy is simple: he will prevent you from drawing
yours. Then both parties will have to fight on empty
stomachs, and neither of them, tacitally, will be a penny
the better. So, unless some elaborate scheme of attack is
brewing, the early hours of the night are comparatively
peaceful. But what is that sudden disturbance in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
front-line trench? A British rifle rings out, then another,
and another, until there is an agitated fusilade from end
to end of the section. Instantly the sleepless host across
the way replies, and for three minutes or so a hurricane
rages. The working parties out in front lie flat on their
faces, cursing patiently. Suddenly the storm dies away,
and perfect silence reigns once more. It was a false
alarm. Some watchman, deceived by the whispers of the
night breeze, or merely a prey to nerves, has discerned a
phantom army approaching through the gloom, and has
opened fire thereon. This often occurs when troops are
new to trench-work.</p>

<p>It is during these hours, too, that regiments relieve
one another in the trenches. The outgoing regiment cannot
leave its post until the incoming regiment has "taken
over." Consequently you have, for a brief space, two
thousand troops packed into a trench calculated to hold
one thousand. Then it is that strong men swear themselves
faint, and the Rugby football player has reason to
be thankful for his previous training in the art of "getting
through the scrum." However perfect your organization
may be, congestion is bound to occur here and there;
and it is no little consolation to us to feel, as we surge
and sway in the darkness, that over there in the German
lines a Saxon and a Prussian private, irretrievably
jammed together in a narrow communication trench, are
consigning one another to perdition in just the same husky
whisper as that employed by Private Mucklewame and his
"opposite number" in the regiment which has come to
relieve him.</p>

<p>These "reliefs" take place every four or five nights.
There was a time, not so long ago, when a regiment was
relieved, not when it was weary, but when another regiment
could be found to replace it. Our own first battalion
once remained in the trenches, unrelieved and only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
securing its supplies with difficulty, for five weeks and
three days. During all that time they were subject to
most pressing attentions on the part of the Boches, but
they never lost a yard of trench. They received word
from Headquarters that to detach another regiment for
their relief would seriously weaken other and most important
dispositions. The Commander-in-Chief would
therefore be greatly obliged if they could hold on. So
they held on.</p>

<p>At last they came out, and staggered back to billets.
Their old quarters, naturally, had long been appropriated
by other troops, and the officers had some difficulty in
recovering their kits.</p>

<p>"I don't mind being kept in trenches for several weeks,"
remarked their commander to the staff officer who received
him when he reported, "and I can put up with
losing my sleeping-bag; but I do object to having my
last box of cigars looted by the blackguards who took
over our billets!"</p>

<p>The staff officer expressed sympathy, and the subject
dropped. But not many days later, when the battalion
were still resting, their commander was roused in the
middle of the night from the profound slumber which
only the experience of many nights of anxious vigil can
induce, by the ominous message:&mdash;</p>

<p>"An orderly to see you, from General Headquarters,
sir!"</p>

<p>The colonel rolled stoically out of bed, and commanded
that the orderly should be brought before him.</p>

<p>The man entered, carrying, not a despatch, but a package,
which he proffered with a salute.</p>

<p>"With the Commander-in-Chief's compliments, sir!"
he announced.</p>

<p>The package was a box of cigars!</p>

<p>But that was before the days of "K(1)."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>But the night is wearing on. It is half-past one&mdash;time
to knock off work. Tired men, returning from ration-drawing
or sap-digging, throw themselves down and
fall dead asleep in a moment. Only the sentries, with
their elbows on the parapet, maintain their sleepless
watch. From behind the enemy's lines comes a deep
boom&mdash;then another. The big guns are waking up again,
and have decided to commence their day's work by speeding
our empty ration-wagons upon their homeward way.
Let them! So long as they refrain from practising direct
hits on our front-line parapet, and disturbing our
brief and hardly-earned repose, they may fire where they
please. The ration train is well able to look after itself.</p>

<p>"A whiff o' shrapnel will dae nae harrm to thae strawberry-jam
pinchers!" observes Private Tosh bitterly, rolling
into his dugout. By this opprobrious term he designates
that distinguished body of men, the Army Service
Corps. A prolonged diet of plum-and-apple jam has
implanted in the breasts of the men in the trenches certain
dark and unworthy suspicions concerning the entire
altruism of those responsible for the distribution of the
Army's rations.</p>


<h3>VI&mdash;DAYBREAK&mdash;"STAND TO ARMS!"</h3>

<p>It is close on daybreak, and the customary whispered
order runs down the stertorous trench:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stand to arms!"</p>

<p>Straightway the parapets are lined with armed men;
the waterproof sheets which have been protecting the
machine-guns from the dews of night are cast off; and
we stand straining our eyes into the whitening darkness.</p>

<p>This is the favorite hour for attack. At any moment
the guns may open fire upon our parapet, or a solid wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of gray-clad figures rise from that strip of corn-land less
than a hundred yards away, and descend upon us. Well,
we are ready for them. Just by way of signalizing the
fact, there goes out a ragged volley of rifle fire, and a
machine-gun rips off half a dozen bursts into the standing
corn. But apparently there is nothing doing this
morning. The day grows brighter, but there is no movement
upon the part of Brother Boche.</p>

<p>But&mdash;what is that light haze hanging over the enemy's
trenches? It is slight, almost impalpable, but it appears
to be drifting towards us. Can it be&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>Next moment every man is hurriedly pulling his gas
helmet over his head, while Lieutenant Waddell beats a
frenzied tocsin upon the instrument provided for the
purpose&mdash;to wit, an empty eighteen-pounder shell, which,
suspended from a bayonet stuck into the parados (or
back wall) of the trench, makes a most efficient alarm-gong.
The sound is repeated all along the trench, and in
two minutes every man is in his place, cowled like a member
of the Holy Inquisition, glaring through an eye-piece
of mica, and firing madly into the approaching wall of
vapour.</p>

<p>But the wall approaches very slowly&mdash;in fact, it almost
stands still&mdash;and finally, as the rising sun disentangles
itself from a pink horizon and climbs into the sky, it
begins to disappear. In half an hour nothing is left, and
we take off our helmets, sniffing the morning air dubiously.
But all we smell is the old mixture&mdash;corpses and
chloride of lime.</p>

<p>The incident, however, was duly recorded by Major
Kemp in his report of the day's events, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>4.7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>&mdash;<i>Gas alarm, false. Due either to morning
mist, or the fact that enemy found breeze insufficient,
and discontinued their attempt.</i></p>

<p>"Still, I'm not sure," he continued, slapping his bald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
head with a bandanna handkerchief, "that a whiff of chlorine
or bromine wouldn't do these trenches a considerable
amount of good. It would tone down some of the
deceased a bit, and wipe out these infernal flies. Waddell,
if I give you a shilling, will you take it over to the
German trenches and ask them to drop it into the meter?"</p>

<p>"I do not think, sir," replied the literal Waddell, "that
an English shilling would fit a German meter. Probably
a mark would be required, and I have only a franc. Besides,
sir, do you think that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Surgical operation at seven-thirty, sharp!" intimated
the major to the medical officer, who entered the dugout
at that moment. "For our friend here"&mdash;indicating the
bewildered Waddell. "Sydney Smith's prescription!
Now, what about breakfast?"</p>


<h3>VII&mdash;NINE O'CLOCK&mdash;"A LITTLE MORNING
HATE"</h3>

<p>About nine o'clock the enemy indulges in what is
usually described, most disrespectfully, as "a little morning
hate"&mdash;in other words, a bombardment. Beginning
with a <i>hors d'&oelig;uvre</i> of shrapnel along the reserve trench&mdash;much
to the discomfort of Headquarters, who are shaving&mdash;he
proceeds to "search" a tract of woodland in our
immediate rear, his quarry being a battery of motor machine-guns,
which has wisely decamped some hours previously.
Then, after scientifically "traversing" our second
line, which has rashly advertised its position and
range by cooking its breakfast over a smoky fire, he
brings the display to a superfluous conclusion by dropping
six "Black Marias" into the deserted ruins of a village
not far behind us. After that comes silence; and
we are able, in our hot, baking trenches, assisted by
clouds of bluebottles, to get on with the day's work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>This consists almost entirely in digging. As already
stated, these are bad trenches. The parapet is none too
strong&mdash;at one point it has been knocked down for three
days running&mdash;the communication trenches are few and
narrow, and there are not nearly enough dugouts. Yesterday
three men were wounded; and owing to the impossibility
of carrying a stretcher along certain parts of
the trench, they had to be conveyed to the rear in their
ground-sheets&mdash;bumped against projections, bent round
sharp corners, and sometimes lifted, perforce, bodily into
view of the enemy. So every man toils with a will, knowing
full well that in a few hours' time he may prove to
have been his own benefactor. Only the sentries remain
at the parapets. They no longer expose themselves, as
at night, but take advantage of the laws of optical reflection,
as exemplified by the trench periscope. (This,
in spite of its grand title, is nothing but a tiny mirror
clipped on to a bayonet.)</p>

<p>At half-past twelve comes dinner&mdash;bully-beef, with biscuit
and jam&mdash;after which each tired man, coiling himself
up in the trench, or crawling underground, according to
the accommodation at his disposal, drops off into instant
and heavy slumber. The hours from two till five in the
afternoon are usually the most uneventful of the twenty-four,
and are therefore devoted to hardly-earned repose.</p>


<h3>VIII&mdash;STORY OF AN AFTERNOON WITH
CAPTAIN BLAIKIE
</h3>
<p>But there is to be little peace this afternoon. About
half-past three, Bobby Little, immersed in pleasant dreams&mdash;dreams
of cool shades and dainty companionship&mdash;is
brought suddenly to the surface of things by&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whoo-oo-<i>oo</i>-oo-UMP!"&mdash;followed
by a heavy thud upon the roof of his dugout.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Earth and small stones descend in a shower upon
him.</p>

<p>"Dirty dogs!" he comments, looking at his watch.
Then he puts his head out of the dugout.</p>

<p>"Lie close, you men!" he cries. "There's more of this
coming. Any casualties?"</p>

<p>The answer to the question is obscured by another
burst of shrapnel, which explodes a few yards short of
a parapet, and showers bullets and fragments of shell
into the trench. A third and a fourth follow. Then
comes a pause. A message is passed down for the
stretcher-bearers. Things are growing serious. Five
minutes later Bobby, having despatched his wounded to
the dressing-station, proceeds with all haste to Captain
Blaikie's dugout.</p>

<p>"How many, Bobby?"</p>

<p>"Six wounded. Two of them won't last as far as the
rear, I'm afraid, sir."</p>

<p>Captain Blaikie looks grave.</p>

<p>"Better ring up the Gunners, I think. Where are the
shells coming from?"</p>

<p>"That wood on our left front, I think."</p>

<p>"That's P 27. Telephone orderly, there?"</p>

<p>A figure appears in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Yes, sirr."</p>

<p>"Ring up Major Cavanagh, and say that H 21 is being
shelled from P 27. Retaliate!"</p>

<p>"Verra good, sirr."</p>

<p>The telephone orderly disappears, to return in five
minutes.</p>

<p>"Major Cavanagh's compliments, sirr, and he is coming
up himself for tae observe from the firing trench."</p>

<p>"Good egg!" observes Captain Blaikie. "Now we shall
see some shooting, Bobby!"</p>

<p>Presently the Gunner major arrives, accompanied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
an orderly, who pays out wire as he goes. The major adjusts
his periscope, while the orderly thrusts a metal peg
into the ground and fits a telephone receiver to his head.</p>

<p>"Number one gun!" chants the major, peering into
his periscope; "three-five-one-nothing&mdash;lyddite&mdash;fourth
charge!"</p>

<p>These mystic observations are repeated into the telephone
by the Cockney orderly, in a confidential undertone.</p>

<p>"Report when ready!" continues the major.</p>

<p>"Report when ready!" echoes the orderly. Then&mdash;"Number
one gun ready, sir!"</p>

<p>"Fire!"</p>

<p>"Fire!" Then, politely&mdash;"Number one has fired, sir."</p>

<p>The major stiffens to his periscope, and Bobby Little,
deeply interested, wonders what has become of the report
of the gun. He forgets that sound does not travel much
faster than a thousand feet a second, and that the guns
are a mile and a half back. Presently, however, there is
a distant boom. Almost simultaneously the lyddite shell
passes overhead with a scream. Bobby, having no periscope,
cannot see the actual result of the shot, though he
tempts Providence (and Zacchæus) by peering over the
top of the parapet.</p>

<p>"Number one, two-nothing minutes more right," commands
the major. "Same range and charge."</p>

<p>Once more the orderly goes through his ritual, and
presently another shell screams overhead.</p>

<p>Again the major observes the result.</p>

<p>"Repeat!" he says. "Nothing-five seconds more right."</p>

<p>This time he is satisfied.</p>

<p>"Parallel lines on number one," he commands crisply.
"One round battery fire&mdash;twenty seconds!"</p>

<p>For the last time the order is passed down the wire,
and the major hands his periscope to the ever-grateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Bobby, who has hardly got his eyes to the glass when the
round of battery fire commences. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;the
avenging shells go shrieking on their way, at
intervals of twenty seconds. There are four muffled
thuds, and four great columns of earth and <i>débris</i> spring
up before the wood. Answer comes there none. The offending
battery has prudently effaced itself.</p>

<p>"Cease fire!" says the major, "and register!" Then he
turns to Captain Blaikie.</p>

<p>"That'll settle them for a bit," he observes. "By the
way, had any more trouble with Minnie?"</p>

<p>"We had Hades from her yesterday," replies Blaikie,
in answer to this extremely personal question. "She
started at a quarter-past five in the morning, and went on
till about ten."</p>


<h3>IX&mdash;STORY OF "MINNIE&mdash;THE MOST
UNPLEASANT OF HER SEX"</h3>

<p>(Perhaps, at this point, it would be as well to introduce
Minnie a little more formally. She is the most
unpleasant of her sex, and her full name is <i>Minenwerfer</i>,
or German trench-mortar. She resides, spasmodically, in
Unter den Linden. Her extreme range is about two
hundred yards, so she confines her attentions to front-line
trenches. Her <i>modus operandi</i> is to discharge a
large cylindrical bomb into the air. The bomb, which is
about fifteen inches long and some eight inches in diameter,
describes a leisurely parabola, performing grotesque
somersaults on the way, and finally falls with a soft thud
into the trench or against the parapet. There, after an
interval of ten seconds, Minnie's offspring explodes; and
as she contains about thirty pounds of dynamite, no dugout
or parapet can stand against her.)</p>

<p>"Did she do much damage?" inquires the Gunner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Killed two men and buried another. They were in a
dugout."</p>

<p>The Gunner shakes his head.</p>

<p>"No good taking cover against Minnie," he says. "The
only way is to come out into the open trench, and dodge
her."</p>

<p>"So we found," replies Blaikie. "But they pulled our
legs badly the first time. They started off with three
'whizz-bangs'"&mdash;a whizz-bang is a particularly offensive
form of shell which bursts two or three times over, like
a Chinese cracker&mdash;"so we all took cover and lay low.
The consequence was that Minnie was able to send her
little contribution along unobserved. The filthy thing fell
short of the trench, and exploded just as we were all
getting up again. It smashed up three or four yards
of parapet, and scuppered the three poor chaps I mentioned."</p>

<p>"Have you located her?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Just behind that stunted willow, on our left
front. I fancy they bring her along there to do her bit,
and then trot her back to billets, out of harm's way. She
is their two o'clock turn&mdash;two <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> <i>and two</i> <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>"</p>

<p>"Two o'clock turn&mdash;h'm!" says the Gunner major meditatively.
"What about our chipping in with a one-fifty-five
turn&mdash;half a dozen H E shells into Minnie's dressing-room&mdash;eh?
I must think this over."</p>

<p>"Do!" said Blaikie cordially. "Minnie is Willie's
Worst Werfer, and the sooner she is put out of action the
better for all of us. To-day, for some reason, she failed
to appear, but previous to that she has not failed for five
mornings in succession to batter down the same bit of
our parapet."</p>

<p>"Where's that?" asks the major, getting out a trench-map.</p>

<p>"P 7&mdash;a most unhealthy spot. Minnie pushes it over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
about two every morning. The result is that we have to
mount guard over the breach all day. We build everything
up again at night, and Minnie sits there as good as
gold, and never dreams of interfering. You can almost
hear her cooing over us. Then, as I say, at two o'clock,
just as the working party comes in and gets under cover,
she lets slip one of her disgusting bombs, and undoes the
work of about four hours. It was a joke at first, but we
are getting fed up now. That's the worst of the Boche.
He starts by being playful; but if not suppressed at
once, he gets rough; and that, of course, spoils all the
harmony of the proceedings. So I cordially commend
your idea of the one-fifty-five turn, sir."</p>

<p>"I'll see what can be done," says the major. "I think
the best plan would be a couple of hours' solid frightfulness,
from every battery we can switch on. To-morrow
afternoon, perhaps, but I'll let you know. You'll
have to clear out of this bit of trench altogether, as we
shall shoot pretty low. So long!"</p>


<h3>X&mdash;HOW HOURS PASS IN THE DUGOUT</h3>

<p>It is six o'clock next evening, and peace reigns over
our trench. This is the hour at which one usually shells
aeroplanes&mdash;or rather, at which the Germans shell ours,
for their own seldom venture out in broad daylight. But
this evening, although two or three are up in the blue,
buzzing inquisitively over the enemy's lines, their attendant
escort of white shrapnel puffs is entirely lacking.
Far away behind the German lines a house is burning
fiercely.</p>

<p>"The Hun is a bit <i>piano</i> to-night," observes Captain
Blaikie, attacking his tea.</p>

<p>"The Hun has been rather firmly handled this afternoon,"
replies Captain Wagstaffe. "I think he has had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
an eye-opener. There are no flies on our Divisional Artillery."</p>

<p>Bobby Little heaved a contented sigh. For two hours
that afternoon he had sat, half-deafened, while six-inch
shells skimmed the parapet in both directions, a few feet
above his head. The Gunner major had been as good as
his word. Punctually at one-fifty-five "Minnie's" two
o'clock turn had been anticipated by a round of high-explosive
shells directed into her suspected place of residence.
What the actual result had been nobody knew,
but Minnie had made no attempt to raise her voice since.
Thereafter the German front-line trenches had been "plastered"
from end to end, while the trenches farther back
were attended to with methodical thoroughness. The
German guns had replied vigorously, but directing only a
passing fire at the trenches, had devoted their efforts
chiefly to the silencing of the British artillery. In this
enterprise they had been remarkably unsuccessful.</p>

<p>"Any casualties?" asked Blaikie.</p>

<p>"None here," replied Wagstaffe. "There may be some
back in the support trenches."</p>

<p>"We might telephone and inquire."</p>

<p>"No good at present. The wires are all cut to pieces.
The signallers are repairing them now."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> was nearly a casualty," confessed Bobby modestly.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"That first shell of ours nearly knocked my head off!
I was standing up at the time, and it rather took me by
surprise. It just cleared the parados. In fact, it kicked
a lot of gravel into the back of my neck."</p>

<p>"Most people get it in the neck here, sooner or later,"
remarked Captain Blaikie sententiously. "Personally, I
don't much mind being killed, but I do bar being buried
alive. That is why I dislike Minnie so." He rose, and
stretched himself. "Heigho! I suppose it's about time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
we detailed patrols and working parties for to-night.
What a lovely sky! A truly peaceful atmosphere&mdash;what?
It gives one a sort of Sunday-evening feeling, somehow."</p>

<p>"May I suggest an explanation?" said Wagstaffe.</p>

<p>"By all means."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> Sunday evening!"</p>

<p>Captain Blaikie whistled gently, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"By Jove, so it is." Then, after a pause: "This time
last Sunday&mdash;"</p>


<p>XI&mdash;A SOLDIER'S SUNDAY AT THE FRONT</p>

<p>Last Sunday had been an off-day&mdash;a day of cloudless
summer beauty. Tired men had slept; tidy men had
washed their clothes; restless men had wandered at ease
about the countryside, careless of the guns which
grumbled everlastingly a few miles away. There had
been impromptu Church Parades for each denomination,
in the corner of a wood which was part of the demesne
of a shell-torn château.</p>

<p>It is a sadly transformed wood. The open space before
the château, once a smooth expanse of tennis-lawn, is
now a dusty picketing-ground for transport mules, destitute
of a single blade of grass. The ornamental lake is
full of broken bottles and empty jam-tins. The pagoda-like
summer house, so inevitable to French château gardens,
is a quartermaster's store. Half the trees have
been cut down for fuel. Still, the July sun streams very
pleasantly through the remainder, and the Psalms of
David float up from beneath their shade quite as sweetly
as they usually do from the neighborhood of the precentor's
desk in the kirk at home&mdash;perhaps sweeter.</p>

<p>The wood itself is a <i>point d'appui</i>, or fortified post.
One has to take precautions, even two or three miles behind
the main firing line. A series of trenches zigzags
in and out among the trees, and barbed wire is interlaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
with the undergrowth. In the farthermost corner lies an
improvised cemetery. Some of the inscriptions on the
little wooden crosses are only three days old. Merely
to read a few of these touches the imagination and stirs
the blood. Here you may see the names of English Tommies
and Highland Jocks, side by side with their Canadian
kith and kin. A little apart lie more graves, surmounted
by epitaphs written in strange characters, such
as few white men can read. These are the Indian
troops. There they lie, side by side&mdash;the mute wastage
of war, but a living testimony, even in their last sleep, to
the breadth and unity of the British Empire. The great,
machine-made Empire of Germany can show no such
graves: when her soldiers die, they sleep alone.</p>

<p>The Church of England service had come last of all.
Late in the afternoon a youthful and red-faced chaplain
had arrived on a bicycle, to find a party of officers and
men lying in the shade of a broad oak waiting for him.
(They were a small party: naturally, the great majority
of the regiment are what the identity-discs call "Pres"
or "R.C.")</p>

<p>"Sorry to be late, sir," he said to the senior officer,
saluting. "This is my sixth sh&mdash;service to-day, and I
have come seven miles for it."</p>

<p>He mopped his brow cheerfully; and having produced
innumerable hymn-books from a saddle-bag and set his
congregation in array, read them the service, in a particularly
pleasing and well-modulated voice. After that
he preached a modest and manly little sermon, containing
references which carried Bobby Little, for one, back
across the Channel to other scenes and other company.
After the sermon came a hymn, sung with great vigor.
Tommy loves singing hymns&mdash;when he happens to know
and like the tune.</p>

<p>"I know you chaps like hymns," said the padre, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
they had finished. "Let's have another before you go.
What do you want?"</p>

<p>A most unlikely-looking person suggested "Abide
with Me." When it was over, and the party, standing as
rigid as their own rifles, had sung "God Save the King,"
the preacher announced awkwardly&mdash;almost apologetically&mdash;</p>

<p>"If any of you would like to&mdash;er&mdash;communicate, I shall
be very glad. May not have another opportunity for
some time, you know. I think over there"&mdash;he indicated
a quiet corner of the wood, not far from the little cemetery&mdash;"would
be a good place."</p>

<p>He pronounced the benediction, and then, after further
recurrence to his saddle-bag, retired to his improvised
sanctuary. Here, with a ration-box for altar, and strands
of barbed wire for choir-stalls, he made his simple preparations.</p>

<p>Half a dozen of the men, and all the officers, followed
him. That was just a week ago.</p>

<p>Captain Wagstaffe broke the silence at last.</p>

<p>"It's a rotten business, war," he said pensively&mdash;"when
you come to think of it. Hallo, there goes the first star-shell!
Come along, Bobby!"</p>

<p>Dusk had fallen. From the German trenches a thin
luminous thread stole up into the darkening sky, leaned
over, drooped, and burst into dazzling brilliance over
the British parapet. Simultaneously a desultory rifle fire
crackled down the lines. The night's work had begun.</p>

<p>(Ian Hay relates innumerable stories, each filled with
absorbing human emotions. Among them are: "The Conversion
of Private M'Slattery;" "Shooting Straight;"
"Deeds of Darkness;" "The Gathering of the Eagles;"
"The Battle of the Slag-Heaps," all of which are the narratives
of a trained novelist direct from the battlefield.)</p>

<h2>SOME EXPERIENCES IN HUNGARY</h2>

<div class="center"><i>In the Palace of Prince and Princess K&mdash;&mdash;</i></div>

<div class="center"><i>By Mina MacDonald, English Companion to the Two
Daughters of a Hungarian Magnate</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>These experiences of an English girl throw a new light on the
character of the Hungarian noble families. At the outbreak of
the War, she was companion to the two daughters of a Hungarian
Prince who resided in the vicinity of Pressburg. This
gave her an opportunity of gauging the sentiments of those connected
with the House of Hapsburg. They discussed the War
with frankness in her presence. The family treated her precisely
as one of their own and at no time considered her as an
"enemy alien." In the preface to her narrative, Miss MacDonald
says: "If other British subjects in Austria proper were treated
more rigorously, they must lay the blame on instructions received
from Berlin. My own experiences in the Hungarian family during
the throes of a World War may, perchance, induce British
(and American) readers to think more highly of the gallant
Magyar race." Selections from her narrative are here presented
by courtesy of her publishers, <i>Longmans, Green and Company</i>.</p></blockquote>

I&mdash;THE CASTLE IN THE CARPATHIANS</h3>

<p>The village of K&mdash;&mdash; stands in a pleasant mountain
valley among the White Carpathians on the borders of
Moravia.... It cannot even lay claim to the various
dissensions of its neighbouring town S&mdash;&mdash; where representatives
of every race, religion, and political party to be
found in Austria and Hungary, keep the town like a
boiling pot. It is far otherwise in K&mdash;&mdash; which is solidly
and frankly Clovak, Catholic, and anti-Austrian. The
peasants who, with the exception of the priest, the schoolmaster
and the inn-keeper, constitute the population of
village, are all dirty, drunken, hard-working, and intelligent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Schloss is an old white building full of beauty and
interest, built on the hill below the village, in the midst
of a park where Maria Therese used to hunt.... The
gardens which surround the Schloss are so beautifully
laid out and so ornamented with fountains and statues
that K&mdash;&mdash; is known to Hungarians as the Miniature
Versailles; the head gardener being a person of such
serious importance in K&mdash;&mdash; that even the Herrschaft at
the Schloss speak of and treat him not as an ordinary
gardener but as a Man of Art. Indoors, too, the house
confirms its reputation of being a small Versailles, for
the collection of pictures and antiquities, begun centuries
ago, is pursued by the Prince of to-day with vigour, and
carping guests have been heard to remark that though
there wasn't a chair in the Schloss but had a history and
a value that made ordinary mortals' hair stand on end,
there also wasn't one that offered any ease or comfort
except in the Prince's den where all was modern&mdash;but
sacred to the Prince.</p>

<p>Life was always merry at the Schloss, and it was a
very jolly party that Excellenz von R&mdash;&mdash; found gathered
there when she arrived hot and cross from Vienna, on
June 28, 1914, bringing her bad news. We were: the
Prince and Princess&mdash;the best-natured and most happy-go-lucky
of all hosts and hostesses; their daughters,
Claire aged twenty-one, fair, blue-eyed and very beautiful,
and Billy aged eighteen, large and dark and interested
in all things pertaining to sport; General T&mdash;&mdash;, round,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
white-haired, and explosive&mdash;once Commandant of a
very famous Galician fortress, but now living in irksome
retirement in Vienna; his son Walther, a lieutenant of
Uhlans, known to us as "The Babe"; finally, myself,
known to everybody as Jerry&mdash;a name which no circumstances
could make beautiful, and which became heart-breaking
when invariably pronounced there as "Sherry."</p>

<p>Everybody knew and liked Excellenz von R&mdash;&mdash;, who
was a very gay and enterprising old lady, and Claire,
Billy, and I who had looked forward in pleasure to her
coming, awaited her at the gates and clambered into the
carriage from both sides as it passed&mdash;for Jan, the coachman
who had driven Excellencies to and from the Schloss
for the past twenty-five years, found it beneath his dignity
to stop at the gates to take us in, so we tumbled in
as best we could on and around Excellenz, whose face
was long and tragic.</p>


<h3>II&mdash;"THE ARCHDUKE AND SOPHIE WERE
SHOT TO-DAY"</h3>

<p>"Ach, my dear children, have mercy on old bones!
And I bring you bad news! The Tronfolger and his
wife were shot to-day in Sarajevo. Oh, poor Sophie!"
and Excellenz, who was an intimate friend of the
Duchess, burst into tears. "It's quite true too&mdash;official
before I left Vienna this afternoon."</p>

<p>But Jan was before her at the house and called as he
drove up, to the footman on the steps&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tronfolger mit Frau heute geschossen."</p>

<p>German, which he insisted on speaking, was not Jan's
strong point. The footman, a Bohemian and anti-Austrian,
sniffed at this lack of breeding, and answered very
casually "So." Excellenz, though she was still weeping,
was very angry and shook her fist at Jan, but she got her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
innings in the hall where the Princess was awaiting&mdash;in
perplexity as she saw Excellenz's wrath and tears.</p>

<p>"What, Francesca, you arrive in tears at K&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I should think I do&mdash;it's too awful," and Excellenz
sobbed out her news.</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" said the Princess. "How can you
believe these wild stories? Besides, who would shoot
that pair?"</p>

<p>"But it's official."</p>

<p>"What is official?" asked the Prince appearing.</p>

<p>"The Archduke and Sophie were shot to-day in Sarajevo."</p>

<p>"Then what the devil made them go there? They
might know beforehand that they wouldn't get out of
there with whole skins," he replied, greeting his guest.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room I found the General, who in the
excitement of the moment had been forgotten. He said
as usual, "Pooh! that's not a funny joke, Sherry."</p>

<p>"That may be; but it's official, and you ought not to
receive your 'officials' with 'pooh,' but perhaps it's your
way here. Here is Excellenz von R&mdash;&mdash; in tears&mdash;she
has brought the news from Vienna."</p>

<p>"Old wives' tales! I don't believe it."</p>

<p>Excellenz nevertheless persuaded him.</p>

<p>"Donnerwetter! Jesus Maria! And she tried to save
him! Plucky woman&mdash;always was plucky. Skinflint
though&mdash;a skinflint. Too fond of the Jesuits! This plot
was arranged in Serbia, I'll stake my life&mdash;stake my life.
Ach, those Serbs! The scum of creation&mdash;scum of creation!
We must exterminate them one day. They have
always been a trouble, but this will bring about their
end at last. Ach, the poor Archduke and the poor
Duchess! Ach! Pooh!"</p>

<p>"Personally," said the Prince, "I think you needn't be
so angry with the Serbs. They've done us a good turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
really. The Archduke&mdash;it's useless to pretend otherwise,
General&mdash;was the best hated man in Austria, and the
Duchess the best-hated woman. Both cared only for the
Church. They won't really be regretted. The young
Karl Franz Josef may be the saving of Austria at a
critical moment."</p>


<h3>III&mdash;GLIMPSES OF THE LIFE OF A PRINCESS</h3>

<p>Excellenz von R&mdash;&mdash; during her stay in K&mdash;&mdash; remained
sad over the murder of her friend, and no one
spoke of anything but the political complications which
might ensue. The plot, it seemed, had been known to the
military and civil authorities in Sarajevo, and several
arrests made even before the tragedy. The Archduke
was very uneasy, and asked the Governor, General
Potiorek, if it was safe to venture out to the reception in
the town hall. "Absolutely safe," General Potiorek was
unwise enough to reply, "I can stake my own life on your
Highnesses' safety."</p>

<p>After Excellenz von R&mdash;&mdash; returned to Vienna the
Bores arrived <i>en masse</i> to spend the whole month of
July in K&mdash;&mdash;. They were the Princess's young brother
Count R&mdash;&mdash;, his wife, and children, Elizabeth and
Stefan. It is not without reason that they are known as
the Bores. The Count was the most bearable of them&mdash;but
even he was trying to one's nerves in hot weather.
He was gay and irresponsible&mdash;had squandered his own
fortune, and as much of his wife's as she would allow
him, at baccarat. His particular sin was his unfortunate
habit of writing verse to each and all of us and singing
it, to his own melodies, on every embarrassing occasion.
His verse was clever&mdash;and usually true, consequently it
annoyed. The countess was a politician, devoting her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
attentions to the General, who spent his days in trying to
avoid her.</p>

<p>"Jesus Maria!" he would say when, red and panting,
he had made good his escape. "In all my years in Bosnia
and Galicia I never had anything like this&mdash;pooh!"</p>

<p>Elizabeth&mdash;usually called Bethi&mdash;was sixteen, and
Stefan was twelve. Both were small but they overran
the whole Schloss; no person or thing was sacred to
them, and no room escaped invasion.... Bethi was being
educated in the Convent of the Sacré C&oelig;ur in Budapest,
where all disliking her, the nuns advised her mother
to have the girl's education completed at home&mdash;an advice
which we in Schloss K&mdash;&mdash; could so well understand
and sympathise with!...</p>

<p>The children were always first in church, occupying the
most comfortable chairs in the chancel. Once they actually
established themselves in the large velvet chairs
placed for the Prince and Princess. Billy could not succeed
in dislodging them, and Claire and I, on arrival, had
to use force&mdash;to the amusement of all the peasant children&mdash;which
so insulted Stefan that he sulked during
Mass till he conceived the brilliant idea of stretching out
his foot far enough to trip up an altar boy. The priest
stumbled in the "Lavabo inter innocentes manus meas,"
and the old church servant, who had in earlier days been
the village schoolmaster, shot out of the sacristy, as was
his custom when the attention of the acolytes wandered,
and soundly cuffed the unfortunate altar-boy. Happily
the Countess had seen, and Stefan had a very bad quarter
of an hour afterwards in the Schloss.</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;DARK DAYS AFTER THE TRAGEDY
</h3>
<p>There were days of tension after the ultimatum went
to Serbia. The press was very restrained but clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
uneasy, and did not attempt to justify the extravagant
tone of the ultimatum. General opinion as to whether
the Serbs would fight or not was not very divided, and
there were few who did not agree that Serbia was never
intended to fight. She was simply to behave herself in
future and Austria was to see that she did it. General
T&mdash;&mdash; was indignant at the ultimatum.</p>

<p>"Berchtold again! Soft-headed fool&mdash;pooh! There
are so many ways of getting what one wants&mdash;he must
just choose this one! This way may really lead to war,
and we are not prepared&mdash;no money, no munitions&mdash;nothing,
nothing! Ach, it's an awful business! Perhaps
Serbia won't dare to fight ... if the Russians back her
she will!"</p>

<p>"You surely can scarcely imagine that any country
could take such an ultimatum lying down?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Pooh," he replied, "you can't deny that they've always
been a thorn in our flesh. But my country is mad&mdash;mad!
Nobody seems to realise what this can lead to.
The Serbs are good fighters too. If Russia backs them
we're done for. Na, I must get back to Vienna now, for
Walther will have to go if there's war. Pooh&mdash;they're
all crazy everywhere."</p>

<p>Even the Man of Art grew mournful among his rosebushes.
He was Croatian and bitterly anti-Austrian.</p>

<p>"Ach, Fräulein! There are sad days coming, for that
wasn't an ultimatum that went to Serbia&mdash;it was a declaration
of war. The Serbs will fight, Fräulein. I know
the race; they are brave men such as we have in Croatia.
Of course they'll fight. They are real soldiers and have
real officers&mdash;old General Putnik&mdash;that's a man! They'll
beat us, Fräulein, and I'll have to go and fight against
them too&mdash;against my own race. Bah! we're slaves here
in Austria."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>


<h3>V&mdash;THE PRINCE WAS "IRRITATED BY THE
WAR"</h3>

<p>Then came the Serbs' reply and the partial mobilisation
of the Austrian army. Everybody looked grave and
the Prince became distinctly irritable.</p>

<p>"Just in the middle of the harvest, too! What a time
of year to send an ultimatum! How the devil do they
expect me to get my harvest in, if they take my men
away? The lifting of the beets won't even begin for six
weeks yet."</p>

<p>"War will be finished by then," said Billy, "and Serbia
will have ceased to exist."</p>

<p>"And what of little Poli&mdash;the beautiful Dragoon with
the sky-blue coat?" asked Claire. "Won't you have to
return to Göding and join your regiment now?"</p>

<p>"This upsets all my plans for the summer," replied the
soldier, "and it's very annoying, and it's too bad of them
to spring a war upon peace-loving soldiers like this.
They'll telephone to me if they want me, and I won't
move from here till they do."</p>

<p>"And if the telephone is out of order, as it usually is,
you'll be shot as a deserter," said Billy.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I won't go," said Poli, for the Einjährigerfreiwilliger
was a man of peace and did not appreciate
a Government which enforced days of warlike pursuits
upon him each year.</p>

<p>But Poli had to go, for one morning about four o'clock,
as the church bells were ringing the Angelus, the order
for a general mobilisation was "drummed out"&mdash;in Hungary
the town crier always uses a drum. Being much too
sleepy to grasp what he said, I promptly went to sleep
again, and in the morning discovered that I was the one
person in the Schloss who had not been at all upset by
the news, and that I was regarded by all as something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
approaching a monster of callousness. There was the
wildest confusion inside and outside the Schloss when I
came downstairs; all the outdoor servants had gathered
in the courtyard to say good-bye before leaving to report
themselves at their "Kaders"; indoors the housemaids
were crying as they went about their work, and it was
with difficulty that the Princess, Claire, and I managed
at last to get some sort of a breakfast served by a scared-looking
butler. The Prince and Billy had been up at the
stables for some time, for the officials had already arrived
to claim the horses on the Government list. "And all
our riding-horses will have to go&mdash;every one of them,"
sobbed the Princess, "yes, even Hadur&mdash;nothing but
Claire's little horses, which are too young, and one other
pair will be left."</p>


<h3>VI&mdash;WEEPING PEASANTS FLOCK TO WAR</h3>

<p>The road was simply alive&mdash;peasants leading in their
horses, recruits wearing the Hungarian red, white and
green in their hats, cartloads of Jews huddled together
weeping and wailing because their Moishes and Aarons
had to go, wild-looking gipsies who had never done military
service, dancing and singing in the gladness of their
hearts that when others were taken they were left to steal
and sing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The town of S&mdash;&mdash; was seething with excited gesticulating
crowds of people&mdash;all soldiers and recruits were
drunk&mdash;the women-folk sobbing and screaming&mdash;the gipsies
who lived in the town drunken and singing and dancing
like their brethren in the country&mdash;every one was
hurried and anxious, men, women, children and horses
were all mixed up and military automobiles rushing about
everywhere.... We reached the Oberstuhlrichter's door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
in safety, but so bruised and breathless that we could
hardly move. Our friend, the Oberstuhlrichter was so
harassed and overworked, that he had nothing to say but&mdash;"For
the love of Heaven, my dears, go away. I really
know nothing myself except that Germany and Russia
are now in the fray and I've got to get all the recruits
away from here at once. Now go away and leave me."</p>


<h3>VII&mdash;THE WISDOM OF UNCLE PISTA</h3>

<p>From him we went to Aunt Sharolta and Uncle Pista&mdash;in
Hungary all older people are addressed as uncle or
aunt. Aunt Sharolta was nearly blind, but wonderfully
sweet and gentle; and Uncle Pista was small, round and
jovial&mdash;red-faced and white-haired. He always wore a
piece of plaster on his nose, and we often speculated as
to what might be below that plaster, for it certainly never
was changed, and whether it had originally been black
or pink no one knew, for from time immemorial it was
grey. He was the most intrepid politician I have ever
met. He had learned geography sixty years ago, had
forgotten it for fifty, and I doubt if he rightly knew
where Serbia lay from Austria. His daughters' geographical
views were based on their father's.</p>

<p>When, on this particular day, we appeared in their
house, hot and breathless and looking as if we had been
picked out of the hay-stack, we found Uncle Pista bemoaning
his horses and saying that if this sort of thing
would continue he would have no nerves left. Aunt
Sharolta was turning out all her drawers for things to
manufacture into comforts for the soldiers, and having
unearthed a piece of grey material embroidered with
rose-buds she was making it into a chest-protector.</p>

<p>"Our boys," she explained, "will die of cold in Russia,
if we don't make warm clothes for them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's more to the point, my horses will die of cold
in Russia," grumbled Uncle Pista.</p>

<p>"You don't think, then, that the Russians may break
into Galicia?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"What an idea! Our army won't let them. Russia
will take six weeks to mobilise&mdash;she can't do it in less&mdash;and
by that time we shall have finished off Serbia and
we can join the Germans in Russia. It's a pity though
that the German Kaiser didn't keep quiet; of course he
knows best, but there's no question but the Tsar was
very impertinent to him lately, and William is hot-tempered.
I've no doubt it's for the best, and it's one of
God's mercies that we have the Kaiser behind us to help
us against Russia. Our boys will be in St. Petersburg
long before Christmas."</p>


<h3>VIII&mdash;THE PRINCE CALLED THEM ALL FOOLS</h3>

<p>Partridge shooting opened on August 1st, and the
Prince and Billy&mdash;for the keepers were all away at their
Kaders&mdash;collected some beaters&mdash;among whom the
naughty and clever Joszo, resplendent in carpet slippers,
a pair of old gaiters, and an old cartridge belt&mdash;and set
out to a melancholy half-hearted shoot, from which Billy
returned in a dismal humour. They had shot little and
had thought all the time of the men&mdash;German, Austrian,
Russian, and French&mdash;who had shot with them last year
and who were now engaged in shooting one another;
the Prince had spoken all the time, too, of his friend the
Grand Duke Nicholai Nicholaievich, who had hitherto
been such a charming and clever man, but who, now that
he was to lead the Russians, was nothing but a mahogany-coloured
giant; and it was a disgusting world, and
how could anybody ever be happy again....</p>

<p>The days that followed were very anxious. France,
the newspapers said, declared war on Germany; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Austria felt cross and shocked. How could France declare
war on any country when she was herself, as the
whole world knew, so little prepared? But there would
be a revolution in France, and Poincaré would be guillotined
for rushing his country into war like that. Oh,
yes, all were agreed, nothing was surer than that Poincaré
would meet the traitor's death he deserved.... My
return to England had been planned for September, and
I began to think that I ought to try to leave at once, but
this was laughed down.</p>

<p>"How do you propose to go, Jerry&mdash;by private balloon?
For everything on wheels is in the hands of the army at
present. No, whatever happens you must just stay with
us&mdash;even if England should join in, you will easily be
home for Christmas&mdash;the war will be finished long before
then. But England won't fight, so why should we
break our heads about it?"</p>

<p>I pointed out that treaty obligations would hardly allow
Great Britain to stand aside.</p>

<p>"Treaty obligations don't count any more," said the
Prince; "the Germans are in Belgium."</p>

<p>"Great Britain, I imagine, does not accept the German
view of treaty obligations. Can't you really see that
Germany is committing a crime in going through Belgium
like that?" I asked the Prince.</p>

<p>"No, absolutely not, when the French were already in
Belgium before France declared war on Germany. And
even supposing they were not there, Germany would still
be right in forcing her way through&mdash;it's a case of the
survival of the fittest. He's a nice fool that King of the
Belgians! He had simply to allow the Germans through,
and he would have been well paid for it by William. Old
Leopold would not have been so silly."</p>

<p>"There you are right," I said, "he probably would have
sold his country."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Jerry, don't be impertinent! Anything you say
now will be used against you if England declares war on
us. Don't forget you're our prisoner then."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the declaration of war did come it sobered us
somewhat! The Princess quickly recovered and said&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why do you worry about it, Jerry? It's not a matter
between you and me, but between Grey and Berchtold&mdash;let
them scratch each other's eyes out if they like. After
all, I'm not sure that I'm so angry with them, for it
means that now you've got to remain here indefinitely&mdash;nolens
volens. I am very glad, for it will be fearfully
dull here without our usual big shooting parties. And
now come and play bridge."</p>

<p>That was the way in which the Princess looked at it
all the time. It was impossible for me to persuade her
that to have an enemy alien in the house might be very
unpleasant for her: she could never see why, though
England and Germany hated each other so cordially, she
and I could not remain the good friends we had always
been and live peacefully in the same house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was very easy for us to disagree, for, after a course
of the <i>Neue Freie Presse</i>, the <i>Neues Wiener Tagblatt</i>
and the <i>Berliner Tagblatt</i>, with the exception of myself
and the servants&mdash;the majority of whom were Slavs&mdash;the
inmates of Schloss K&mdash;&mdash; were soon convinced that it
was England that had been behind the whole conflagration:
that jealous of Germany's dangerously increasing
foreign trade, she sought to cripple it by a war, and accordingly
it was at England's suggestion that Russia
bribed the Serbs to assassinate the Archduke&mdash;an event
which the Entente felt would certainly force Germany's
hand....</p>

<p>"We are not strong enough to do anything ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and Germany is the one hope of our existence. What can
one do if one is so poor and so divided as we are? Oh,
but Willy will save us&mdash;a plucky dashing fellow who
will teach you all a lesson. You will shed bitter tears in
England yet."</p>

<p>"We shall see, when the war is over, who will laugh and
who will cry," I would reply.</p>


<h3>IX&mdash;THE ROMANCE OF MARISCHA</h3>

<p>I have said that all the servants were anti-Austrian.
I wrong Marischa and probably also Therese. The latter
was the maid who waited on me&mdash;a Vienna girl whose
views were probably orthodox enough.... She was a
scullery-maid&mdash;round as a barrel, with a large, good-humoured
face, was always in a hurry and always smiling,
and dressed always in the black and red costume of
Moravia.... She had had a husband who left her years
ago, going to America, from where he wrote to say that
he had had enough of her and did not intend to return
to her. Then Stefka Stefan came into her life and she
found him irresistible.... He was small, sulky, and
delicate looking, not as one pictures a hero of romance;
but he was very devoted to Marischa and, if she could
have got a divorce from her husband, he would have
married her; but, as she explained to me in her inimitable
way, this wasn't possible.</p>

<p>"Priest say no divorce, so Marischa yes just live like
that with Stefan. Prince and Princess yes give Marischa
and Stefan house. Marischa's husband no good man, but
Stefan yes good man and yes want to marry Marischa:
priest say no possible, so Marischa yes live just like that
with Stefan."</p>

<p>Nevertheless her romance was a very real grief to
Marischa, for the priest at confession would never give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
her absolution, and her enforced abstinence from communion
pained her more than it would many of her class.
The earthly tie was stronger and Stefka Stefan continued
to work in the garden at Schloss K&mdash;&mdash; and to live in
Marischa's cottage. In spite of many protests the Prince
was obdurate and refused to send the couple away, saying,
with easy Hungarian carelessness, that the life in
Marischa's cottage was better and purer than in the next
house where at one side the gamekeeper beat his wife, and
at the other the butler was in turn beaten by his wife.
Marischa's loyalty simply oozed out of her.</p>

<p>"Kaiser brave man, yes brave man. Kaiser fears only
God, so God let Kaiser win."</p>

<p>"Which Kaiser, Marischa?"</p>

<p>"German Kaiser. Our King Kaiser yes old man now
not know like German Kaiser yes know&mdash;fears God&mdash;fears
God."</p>

<p>It was a pity to spoil this beautiful faith, so I always
remained on very good terms with Marischa, who always
greeted me with a smile of affection and pity that was
touching.</p>


<h3>X&mdash;STORIES THE PEASANTS BROUGHT HOME</h3>

<p>News of great deeds soon came from Serbia, where the
Austrians were supposed to be already in the heart of the
country. No lie was ever too big for the Austrian papers,
and the jubilation throughout the country over the imaginary
successes in Serbia knew no bounds....</p>

<p>The fields had become very empty and sad: instead of
the crowds of jolly handsome young peasant lads, singing
their beautiful Slovak songs as they worked, there were
now only a few old men and women, and gipsies who
would follow one any distance begging all the time for
"a Kreutzer for the love of God, Mistress."</p>

<p>The men-servants who had gone to their Kaders soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
began to return. First came the Man of Art. We had
all been sitting outside on the terrace when we heard
that this first of the heroes had returned, and he was at
once summoned to give his report. His heart was bad,
so bad that the doctor feared that the exertion of even a
few days' military service might kill him, therefore&mdash;with
many shakes of his head&mdash;he would never fight for his
country.</p>

<p>"Where did they tell you that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In Agram, Fräulein," very mournfully.</p>

<p>"They didn't expect you to believe it, I hope?"</p>

<p>But the Princess interrupted. "Don't ask these awkward
questions, Jerry. We're much too glad to have
him back again to go very deeply into the details of his
terrible illness. And now, Herr Gärtner, give us all your
news of the war."</p>

<p>He did, and how they wished he didn't!</p>

<p>"The Herrschaft all thought Russia would take six
weeks to mobilise&mdash;well, the Russians are in Galicia now.
Our armies there were far too small and badly prepared,
and they have been cut to pieces. The great body of
troops is being withdrawn from Serbia up to Galicia, and
we have had very serious reverses in Serbia too. It's
our officers that are no good. I travelled with a Bulgarian
who had come from Moscow to Agram through
Roumania, and he says the Russian mobilisation is complete,
and that he didn't think there were so many men
on earth as he saw pouring through Moscow as the
Siberian troops came up. The Herrschaft cannot hear
those things, as they sit in the gardens here away from
it all, but I know for a fact that the Russians are in
Galicia and Lemberg is about to fall."</p>

<p>"And yet the newspapers speak only of the success of
our offensive against Serbia," said Claire, in tears.</p>

<p>"Our newspapers are the most lying on earth, Highness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and I tell you that Austria will lose, and lose badly
in this war."</p>

<p>Consternation of all! An Englishwoman to hear all
this!</p>

<p>"That will do," said the Prince, shortly, "and I should
advise you not to repeat in the village what you've just
said, else you'll get yourself into trouble." The Princess
then hurried the offender off to the gardens before more
could be said.</p>

<p>In a few days the gamekeeper arrived back, to the
annoyance of his wife, who had hoped that the war would
end her beatings for some time. His uncle was an army
doctor, and no reasonable being could expect the gamekeeper
to be strong and well in such circumstances&mdash;heart
disease again, of the most incurable kind. The butler
and the first footman returned from Bohemia&mdash;the one
with varicose veins, and the other with heart disease.</p>

<p>The newspapers were silent about the Russian front,
but became more and more triumphant about events in
Serbia, where Conrad von Hötzendorf expected the
whole Serbian army to be surrounded in a few days by
the Austrians under General Potiorek, who, in his capacity
of Military Governor of Bosnia, when the Archduke
and his wife were shot, had been sent to punish the
Serbs.</p>

<p>I soon began to receive and to send English letters
through Rome, and during the rest of the time I was in
Hungary I had no trouble with my mails, despite the
fact that foreign correspondence was forbidden to enemy
aliens. It was very difficult for me to realise that I was
an enemy alien, for my liberties were hindered in no
way....</p>


<h3>XI&mdash;THE OLD ADMIRAL ARRIVES</h3>

<p>At the end of the month the Admiral arrived from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Vienna. He was no longer young, but he was very enterprising,
and, though for many years retired, he now
offered himself to his country, which was ungrateful
enough to evince no very pressing need of his services....</p>

<p>The Admiral brought us all the news of Vienna, which
he described as being in a state of wild enthusiasm and
satisfaction. Day by day Italy's declaration of war on
the Allies was awaited, and, as expectancy gradually
died, Vienna's rage against Italy knew no bounds. A
popular joke in the city then was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Was ist der Dreibund? Ein Zweibund und ein
Vagabund!"</p>

<p>But, the Admiral assured us, everybody knew that the
Zweibund would win without the Vagabund: Willy would
see to that; he had all that was necessary to win a war,
men, munitions, and brains. No, there never was a man
so plucky as Willy. The Admiral's thoughts, from force
of habit, lingered on things naval, and his morning greeting
was, invariably&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good morning! To-day we shall hear something
from the sea!"</p>

<p>We all grew impatient as time passed and the Admiral's
big sea-battle failed to take place. I once dared to suggest
that the German Fleet was afraid to come out. The
Admiral's remaining hairs literally stood on end.</p>

<p>"Afraid! Oh, Miss Jerry! You must have patience&mdash;they
will come out in time. What do you suppose Willy
built his Dreadnoughts for? To sit in the Kiel Canal,
perhaps?"</p>

<p>There was never even a hint in the Austrian papers of
any doings at sea at all; but the Man of Arts knew of the
clearing of enemy ships from the seas by the Allied Fleets.
It was in the Slav papers.</p>

<p>"But how do you manage to get those papers?" I once
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Na, Fräulein; don't ask me that. To have that
known is as much as my life is worth. But you can be
quite certain that I'm not the only person here who gets
them."</p>

<p>Japan's declaration of war was the surprise of the
Admiral's life, and his rage was almost classic. It was
right, though, he said, for the Allies to welcome the
yellow Japs to their rainbow collection of soldiers!</p>

<p>Uncle Pista was charmingly funny about Japan one
afternoon when Claire, the Admiral, and I went to tea to
Aunt Sharolta.</p>

<p>"Japan will regret what she has done," and in anticipation
of this his face grew rounder and redder. "There
won't be much left of her by the time that Germany's
done with her."</p>

<p>"How is Germany going to manage it?"</p>

<p>"By sending ships and men there, of course," he replied,
contemptuously.</p>

<p>"And how will Germany manage that?" asked the
Admiral, greatly amused.</p>

<p>"How!" repeated the old gentleman. "How does any
ship go anywhere? By crossing the sea, of course."</p>

<p>"What about the British Navy on the way?" asked
Claire.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;would the German boats go near the British
Navy?" and Uncle Pista was surprised and disappointed.</p>

<p>"Not intentionally&mdash;but they might find the British
Navy difficult to avoid," said the Admiral.</p>

<p>"Then they wouldn't avoid it at all," said Uncle Pista,
recovering his spirits. "They would just smash it up, as
they're smashing up the English in Flanders just now,
and then go on, and they would be in Japan in a few
days."</p>

<p>"Good sailing!" commented the Admiral.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there will be an end of Japan and of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
too! Willy will teach them the lesson they need.
How glad I am that no child of mine ever learned English!"
By this time we were literally roaring with laughter,
and he paused in surprise. "What are you all laughing
at? Am I not right?" He had forgotten my
nationality.</p>

<p>"Quite," I said, hoping he would continue. But Aunt
Sharolta looked up from the chest-protector she was
sewing and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is useless for you to talk like that, Pista, when we
are being annihilated in Galicia and Serbia. Oh, yes, I
know the newspapers are very encouraging, but those
who know say otherwise."</p>

<p>"Have patience! Have patience," said the Admiral.
"Trust in Willy. And mark my words, to-morrow we
shall hear something from the sea."</p>

<h2>"FORCED TO FIGHT"&mdash;THE TALE OF
A SCHLESWIG DANE</h2>

<div class="center">"<i>What My Eyes Witnessed in East Prussia</i>"<br /><br />
<i>Told by Erich Erichsen, A Soldier in the German Army
Translated from the Danish by Ingebord Lund</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>This is a tragic story of a Dane who was forced to fight in the
German Army. He was mobilized at the beginning of the War
and forced to serve on the Western and Eastern fronts. He
wrote the first revelations of life in the German trenches. This
is the first authentic account of how Germany makes war from
the lips of a German soldier. After being wounded, disfigured
for life, and a cripple, he went home where his own father
and mother hardly knew him. Twenty editions of his book
have appeared in Danish but for obvious reasons, its sale in
Germany has been prohibited. The experiences herein related
are by permission of his American publishers, <i>Robert M.
McBride and Company</i>.</p></blockquote>

I&mdash;STORY OF SUFFERING ON THE RUSSIAN
FRONT</h3>

<p>On the East front I took part in the great offensive
against the Russians. My old comrade was there also;
he was still alive. But there were many new faces in
my division. The bloody days before Liège, the horrors
of the fight through Belgium, and the long strife
in the trenches of Flanders, had cost many men their
lives or their reason....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>
<p>I remember how Belgium was laid waste. But to
tell the truth, things were much the same in East Prussia.
Before the invasion, it was in many parts a melancholy
country. But it looked more pitiable than
ever, as we marched through it, with the Russians retreating
before us. Trampled fields, ploughed up by
shells, burnt farms, property wantonly injured or destroyed,
towns in ruins and human beings in despair,
robbed of all they had, their happiness, their joy, their
future. It was an indescribable scene of misery and
woe. But at the same time it was exceedingly touching
to see how the greater number of the people clung
to the devastated home, whose master was probably
in the fighting line, if he were not already killed. The
wretched hovels and the ruined farms still sheltered
human creatures, who did their work as best they
could, and hid themselves from the night and the rain
in some cramped space, between half-charred boards
and ends of beams, or whatever they could find to hand.</p>

<p>It was misery. It was poverty. It was wretchedness.
But it was home&mdash;the one fixed point in their
existence. If they once forsook that, they were exposed
to the merciless uncertainty of life. So they
clung to it obstinately and faithfully in spite of all
they had to bear and suffer, both when the Russians
advanced, and when they retreated. Among their
other miseries they had also learnt to know famine.
When the Russians advanced, they did not leave much
behind. Many a time these people begged our last
slice of bread from us, to stay the worst of their
hunger.</p>

<p>We gave to them willingly. I felt at times, that their
lot was far worse than ours. We indeed might lose
our lives in many different ways, and we also knew
what it was to be hungry. But we had not to listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to our children crying for food, or see our tiny infants
sicken and die because there was no milk to be had
and the mother's breasts were empty.</p>

<p>I can well understand why wherever we came, the
people greeted us as their deliverers.</p>

<p>I understand their joy and their often boundless
gratitude in word and deed. I understand why the
old men and the trembling women so often fell upon
our necks with tears of joy.</p>

<p>It must be heart-breaking to see the plot of ground
you love laid waste and trampled down, without being
able to do anything to save it. It must be still
more heart-breaking to see the home that you have
cherished devoured by flames, and then, on dark and
stormy nights, taking your children by the hand or
on your back, and followed by terror-stricken women
and bewildered old people, to flee from that home
and wander along toilsome roads to uncertainty, in
company with hundreds of others who know just as
little where to go for help or safety.</p>

<p>We met many such crowds of homeless wayfarers
on our march, people who could hardly drag themselves
along for hunger and cold and terror.</p>

<p>There were miserable carts drawn by miserable,
starved horses and wretched bits of furniture, piled
up anyhow in haste and fear. There were people
huddled together under the lee of a hedge or in a
wood, or sheltering in the holes they had dug into
banks of earth or dykes, wrapped in rags, starving with
cold and still terror-stricken. Men gazing towards
the homes from which they had fled, looking in bewilderment
and despair at the down-trodden and ruined
country; women lying down and trying to warm their
little ones at a naked, impoverished breast, or groaning
in misery and hopelessness over the dying eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of a child; old men and old women with only one
wish in the world&mdash;the sum and substance of their
prayers from hour to hour being that God would take
them away from all this misery, which they could
not in the least comprehend and which they had not
strength enough to bear.</p>


<h3>II&mdash;"WHAT APPALLING THINGS THEY
TOLD US"</h3>

<p>And what appalling things they told us, in trembling
voices and shaking with sobs!</p>

<p>Not only their homes, their domestic animals and
their furniture had been harried by fire and sword&mdash;it
cannot be otherwise in war, I suppose, for it has
no mercy.</p>

<p>It had been here as it had been in Belgium&mdash;the
soldiers were intoxicated with savagery and the lust
of destruction. In such an army there may be a
thousand scoundrels amongst a hundred thousand
decent men; but scoundrels create new scoundrels,
drink begets coarseness, and coarseness begets violence.
Old men are mocked and tortured, women outraged
without mercy, and innocent little children are
made to suffer without pity. Men have to pay for their
hate and their defiance, even though honest and justifiable,
with military retribution, merely because one
of them has been impudent. He has stirred up and
set ablaze passionate instincts that no one can quench.</p>

<p>I knew what might happen&mdash;I had been through the
whole affair in Belgium. I knew from experience all
that they told me, and a great deal more.... But I
can assure you now, and I shall dare to say it on the
day I have to stand before my Eternal Judge, I have
never of my own impulse harmed any civilian; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
have no murder or other deed of shame on my conscience.
The guilt of whatever I have had a share
in doing is entirely on the heads of those who could
demand it of me. They could demand of me that I
should do my duty and whip me into doing it, or
shoot me if I refused. I had long since sworn loyalty
to the colours. That oath is sacred, like any other
oath. And I was a subject of the country I served
and had to serve.</p>

<p>That being so, may I not be allowed to say that
while I was appalled at what I now saw, I was at the
same time filled with a certain satisfaction. It appalled
me because all horror appals, yet at the same
time there was a certain satisfaction about it, because
I saw in it a just retribution for all that we had done
in Belgium&mdash;a mild and very lenient retribution, by the
way.</p>

<p>Don't you think one may be allowed to say that
without being stamped as cruel and merciless?</p>

<p>There is, amongst my Russian experiences, an incident
which I shall always be glad to cherish with
the warmest gratitude, because it represents to me
what we mortals usually call Nemesis&mdash;that is, chastising
justice, or whatever name you prefer to give
it.</p>

<p>I call it the judgment of God because it seemed as
if there was a leading and guiding hand in it&mdash;a hand
that struck one who was guilty and gave atonement
for two whose lives had been taken.</p>

<p>The rearguard to which I belonged&mdash;I think we
were only a couple of thousand men&mdash;had been billeted
for a day in a fairly large village not far from
the Russian frontier. It was one of the first places
to be laid waste. There were not many farms or
houses left that were not in ruins. The cattle had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
been taken and the corn trodden down. Many homes
were quite deserted, and no one knew where the inmates
were. Besides, who could know at such a
time, when each one had enough to do to save himself
and those belonging to him. Perhaps they were dead;
perhaps terror had driven them to madness; perhaps
they had dragged themselves along, weary to death,
in the train of the fleeing crowds and had fallen by the
wayside in a ditch or at the edge of a forest, left
behind by the others who continued their insensate
flight and took heed of naught but themselves and
their own affairs.</p>

<p>Perhaps they lay by the roadside gazing towards
the home that was now a ruin, at the fires blazing
over the flat country, and up to the heavens where it
seemed to them that everything was forgotten&mdash;mercy,
goodness, justice.</p>

<p>Perhaps they murmured a prayer, the last, the very
last, and then lay down and waited for what was to
come&mdash;for silent, reconciling death, that would bring
them peace and alleviation for all that they had not
been able to endure in a world that seemed to them
to have been quite forsaken by God.</p>

<p>I know that old men were found with their hands
folded on their breasts and the reconciling peace of
death on their wasted, rigid faces.</p>

<p>I know that young women were found with their
infants pressed close to their bare breasts, as if trying
to give them their last warmth, until they had both
gone into the land of everlasting peace, slain by cold
and hunger and terror.</p>


<h3>III&mdash;STORY OF A PRUSSIAN MOTHER</h3>

<p>In one of the poorest of the small houses in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
village lived a young woman. She had been beautiful,
as women in villages often are, a radiant figure of
health and strength, with the perfume and sweetness
of the fields and their sunshine on her lips and in her
eyes. She seemed to be about half-way through her
twenties. But now her face was drawn and pale, and
she dragged herself wearily about as if she were ill.</p>

<p>I remember her home distinctly. It had been a little
six-windowed thatched house near the end of the
village. Two of the windows belonged to a room with
an alcove and the kitchen. The other part of the
house had been allotted to the cow, the pigs, and the
hens.</p>

<p>It was now almost in ruins. The roof was gone,
the woodwork charred, and the walls had tumbled
down in a crumbling heap where the animals had
been. Only the little room with the alcove and the
kitchen were intact, but the window-panes were
smashed, the door battered in, and rags had been stuck
in here and there as a slight protection against wind
and weather.</p>

<p>Behind the house there was a small, down-trodden
garden, hedged about with a dyke of willows and
elders.</p>

<p>On the day when the Russians entered the village
they ravaged it with fire and sword in their savage
exultation. It was said that many of them were
drunk. However that may have been, they forced
their way into farmsteads and houses, took what there
was of cattle and fodder, smashed everything to bits
here and set on fire there, and did not deal gently
with the women in the houses.</p>

<p>The little house at the end of the village was also
visited by a soldier. He stormed and raged and
shouted and spared nothing of the little that could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
spared. Finally he threw himself upon the young wife
and tried to take her by force.</p>

<p>Then the husband rushed upon him to save his
wife's honour. He did not succeed, and it cost him
his life. He fell within the room, killed by the blow
of a sword on his head.</p>

<p>The soldier's savagery increased, and at last it
completely mastered him. He kicked the young
woman till she was nearly beside herself with terror,
and stabbed her little boy, who was lying in the bed,
with a bayonet thrust.</p>

<p>Then only, and not till then, was he satisfied with
his achievements.</p>

<p>The poor woman buried her husband and child the
next day in a corner of the garden and covered the
little mound with flowers.</p>

<p>There was no one who could have helped her to
give them Christian burial. It then became clear to
everyone that she had lost her reason. She went about
muttering continually, with a remote and strange look
in her tearworn eyes, that sometimes looked as if they
were blind. She would often sit for hours on the
garden dyke beside the grave of her husband and
child.</p>

<p>It was extremely sad and pathetic, and heart-rending
to see her sitting there, sometimes till late at night,
as if she were waiting for the two to come back.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would lie down on the grave, pressing
one cheek against the ground, and she would lie
a long time like that&mdash;sometimes until she fell asleep.
If anyone asked her why she lay there she stared vacantly
with a pair of bewildered, tear-bright eyes and
answered through her sobs that she could hear her
little boy crying and calling to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV&mdash;"MY LOVELY LITTLE BOY&mdash;THEY
KILLED HIM"</h3>

<p>Every time a convoy of prisoners passed through
the village she was seized with restlessness. She was
eager and quick in her movements and she stood staring
intently at those who passed by.</p>

<p>It seemed as if she were looking for one particular
face amongst the many hundreds, but when they had
passed by she collapsed again and dragged herself
back to the house, or out to the dyke and the mound
in the corner of the garden.</p>

<p>Towards evening, on the day that we had entered
the village, I was standing outside her house with one
of my comrades. She was going about that evening
moaning as she had never moaned before. Her hair
was hanging in matted strands about her face, and
her clothes were nothing but torn rags. It seemed
as if she had torn them in her horror.</p>

<p>All the time she went on murmuring, between her
moans: "My lovely little boy&mdash;my lovely little
boy!..."</p>

<p>Now and then she clenched one hand in the other
or struck them both against her forehead.</p>

<p>While we were standing by looking at her my lieutenant
came up. He tried to soothe her and patted
her shoulder, but every time he touched her she shuddered
and seemed to shrink in sudden terror.</p>

<p>"My poor little boy!" she moaned. "They killed
him. He was only six years old and was lying in his
bed. 'Pray to God,' I cried to him; 'pray to God.'
I was lying on the floor by his bed and saw him fold
his hands in prayer, while he gazed at me in terror.</p>

<p>"But he who was standing over him did not spare
him. He stabbed him in the breast with his bayonet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and he kicked me along the floor. My husband was
lying murdered on the doorstep; his face was red
with blood; his forehead was cut open."</p>

<p>Her words came in rapid, violent gasps, while she
pressed her hands against her eyes as if to shut out all
the horror she saw before her.</p>

<p>"But there <i>is</i> justice in the world," she screamed.
"There is justice. I shall find him; I shall find him;
I shall find him!..."</p>

<p>Then she grew a little calmer, and the lieutenant
and I stood whispering to each other about what we
had just seen and about what we had heard about
her.</p>


<h3>V&mdash;SHE FINDS AT LAST THE MAN WHO
MURDERED</h3>

<p>Some time after a convoy of prisoners passed by.
There were about two hundred men.</p>

<p>The instant the young woman saw the prisoners she
rushed out on the road. Meanwhile my captain had
come up, too. He stood by her side and closely
watched her movements. She looked like an animal
ready to spring. Every muscle was tense, every nerve
tightened, and meanwhile her eyes scrutinized the prisoners
as they passed by.</p>

<p>There was a strange, penetrating force in her eyes.
They burned like live coals. They flashed like rapiers.</p>

<p>Suddenly she rushed out and almost threw herself
upon one of the prisoners in the convoy. It stopped,
and as she clenched her hands threateningly in the
air she screamed in mingled exultation and agony:
"It's he! It's he! I knew I should find him!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>At first the captive soldier stared at her in surprise.
Suddenly a wave of deep red suffused his face,
and then he turned ashy grey and bent his head. It
looked as if he were slowly sinking on his knees.</p>

<p>The young woman went on crying: "It's he! It's
he! I knew I should find him!"</p>

<p>At last she laughed wildly, a laugh that was more
like a mad shriek, and then collapsed on the roadside
while the froth oozed through her tightly-closed lips.</p>


<h3>VI&mdash;THE GUILTY MAN&mdash;AND JUSTICE</h3>

<p>My friend ceased speaking for a moment, and I
felt a prickling and tingling all over me. It was
emotion and uneasiness both in one.</p>

<p>I looked at him. His eyes had suddenly become
bright and clear, and there was a smile about his narrow
lips of mingled sadness and joy.</p>

<p>I will not tell you anything more about it. I will
not go further into what happened. I will only add
that half an hour later that man was no longer among
the living.</p>

<p><i>We shot him.</i></p>

<p>Was it honourable and just? Is it never permissible
to shoot a prisoner? Perhaps&mdash;perhaps not. I
don't wish to dispute about it with anybody. In this case
that question does not interest me in the least. I don't
care whether it was lawful or not.</p>

<p>I will only honestly and openly declare that to me
this little incident stands out, amongst all the appalling
things I saw, as something infinitely beautiful and
exalted.</p>

<p>I felt that at that moment I had seen cold, stern
Justice face to face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>


<h3>VII&mdash;STORY OF A GERMAN SOLDIER'S
HOME-COMING</h3>

<p>The day I went home was terribly long. It seemed
to me as if my journey would never come to an
end....</p>

<p>I was so deeply stirred that I could have wept. My
lips quivered and my breast was as empty as if all the
air had been pumped out of my lungs.</p>

<p>As the train glided into the small station I pulled
down the window and looked out.</p>

<p>It was all so joyously familiar. The name with the
foreign, snarling sound. The station-master, erect and
stiff, like the old non-commissioned officer with a big
German beard that he was. The flowers on the window-sills
of the station-house. The faces of the station-master's
wife and children against the window-panes.
The smell of asphalte from the sun-baked platform.</p>

<p>And over there&mdash;why, that was my father, <i>my</i> dear,
dear old father! He seemed to me to have aged a
good deal. His broad back, which before had been so
straight and so proudly erect, was bent and tired; and
his face looked worn as if after a long illness.</p>

<p>His glance went down the train from carriage to
carriage. I waved my hand to him and called out:</p>

<p>"Father!"</p>

<p>He turned at the sound and stared at me a moment.</p>

<p>At first a startled look seemed to pass over his face.
A sudden wonder, as when you see something you
have not expected, and then it seemed to me that he
tottered backwards a step or two when he understood
who it was that had called. He bent his head and
pressed his hand to his eyes.</p>

<p>I think he was weeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Then I jumped out of the carriage, and the next instant
I was beside him.</p>


<h3>VIII&mdash;"MY FATHER THANKED GOD"</h3>

<p>He threw his arms round my neck and kissed me
fervently on both cheeks as he whispered in a trembling
voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, thank God we've got you back again! Welcome
home, my dear boy&mdash;welcome&mdash;welcome!
Thanks be to God from your mother and me and all
of us! O my God, my God!&mdash;it has been a hard
time!"</p>

<p>He shook me as you shake a friend in exuberant
joy. And then he took my arm. "Why, I could not
recognize you at first," he said with a little smile.
"You have changed&mdash;somewhat.... But on the
whole you are looking quite well."</p>

<p>"Yes, am I not?" I said. "Quite well&mdash;I think so
myself."</p>

<p>I smiled.</p>

<p>I remembered that that was what they always said
at the hospital....</p>

<p>Then we drove along the road to my home, and in
thirsty eagerness my mind drank in all the old, familiar
and beautiful luxuriance: the white road with
the perfume of the poplars; the hedges with the wild
roses; the white-washed, thatched farmsteads; the
bright, summer gleam of the blue fjord.</p>

<p>It was all just the same as when I left home nearly
two years ago&mdash;so it seemed to me, at any rate. I
could not see any change.</p>

<p>My father had sat silent awhile and had now and
then stolen a glance at me, and I understood why. He
had to feel at home with my face first before he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
feel quite at home with myself. He was never at any
time one to speak much, by the way.</p>

<p>We drove past one of the big farms. The house
stood close up to the road, and looked so peaceful, so
bathed in sunshine; and the blossoms from the fruit
trees sprinkled their pure white snow over the bright
lawns.</p>

<p>"The farmer in there fell last September," said my
father; "and his two sons are also gone. There are
no more men left now in that family....</p>

<p>"The husband is gone over there, and yonder the
son. Both sons from that place are gone. And over
there they have lost a son-in-law&mdash;you know, the one
who had just got married. At the farm yonder the
husband came home a cripple last Christmas; and
the son in that one is blind."</p>

<p>His hushed and mournful words spoke of nothing
but death and grief. There was scarcely a farm or
a house the door of which was not marked with the
cross of death, or in which mourning or disablement
had not a home....</p>


<h3>IX&mdash;"MY FIANCEE&mdash;SHE ONLY WEPT"</h3>

<p>My <i>fiancée</i> was standing in the middle of the yard.
Her face had not the same bright gentleness as before.
About her features and on her lips there were the
same sad and mournful lines that I had seen on the
faces of the women in the hospital. She, too, was
stamped with the daily silent longing and uncertainty,
the nightly dread and heart-ache.</p>

<p>She seemed to me to look old. And she was not
yet twenty-two.</p>

<p>She threw her arms round my neck, almost before
I had reached the ground. She said nothing. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
only cried, clinging closely to me and hiding her face
on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>you</i> can recognise him, it seems," said my
father. "It was all I could do&mdash;just at first...."</p>

<p>She looked at me, and then turned to my father as
she said:</p>

<p>"I <i>knew</i> that he would look like that&mdash;that was how
I always saw him. In my thoughts by day and my
dreams at night."</p>

<p>Then we went into the sitting-room.</p>


<h3>X&mdash;"MY MOTHER&mdash;SHE BROKE DOWN AND
SOBBED"</h3>

<p>My mother was standing by the table. She was
pale and there was a frightened and despairing look in
her eyes.</p>

<p>She gazed at me for a moment as if in terror. Then
she sank down upon a chair and hid her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>"Is that <i>my</i> boy&mdash;is that <i>my</i> boy?..."</p>

<p>It sounded like a heart-broken wailing. I saw that
she was sobbing. I perceived that my face had frightened
her; the empty sleeve too.</p>

<p>I went over and knelt down beside her, putting
my arm round her waist and my head in her lap.</p>

<p>I had always done that as a boy when she was
grieved about anything.</p>

<p>Then I felt her hand gently, stroking my head.
How soft that hand was! What a blissfulness there
was in that quiet, gentle stroking!</p>

<p>Is there anybody who knows how to caress like a
mother? Is there anything in the world that holds
such rapturous joy?...</p>

<p>After a little while she took my chin in her hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and raised my head. Our eyes met. Hers were soft
and shining&mdash;a fathomless deep of love to gaze into.</p>

<p>Her face was grey and there was a quivering about
her firmly-closed lips. But I could see that she was
happy&mdash;silently, speechlessly happy.</p>

<p>I felt her lips on my forehead. It was like a great
solemnity to me. And then she said in a soft whisper:</p>

<p>"My own big boy&mdash;my own big boy&mdash;thank God
for ever that I have you back again!"</p>

<p>A sad little smile passed over her face, and, as if
she felt a desire to say something showing a little of
her warm-hearted and charming humour, she added
between smiles and tears:</p>

<p>"But you are <i>not</i> such a handsome boy as when you
went away."</p>

<p>Then she broke down and bent her face over mine.</p>

<p>That was my home-coming. I had looked forward
to it and it had given me all the happiness I could
wish for.</p>

<h2>"ADVENTURES OF A DESPATCH
RIDER"</h2>

<div class="center"><i>An Oxford Man With the Motorcyclists</i><br /><br />
<i>Told by Capt. W. H. L. Watson</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>This young Oxford student at the outbreak of the War was
in London to begin his work in the British Museum. "At 6:45
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, on Saturday, July 25th, 1914, Alec and I determined to
take part in the Austro-Serbian War. I remember the exact
minute," he says. They were certain Armageddon was coming.
He went straight to Scotland Yard and joined the Despatch
Riders with several of his fellow students. He then began his
daring adventures carrying despatches for the British Army in
Northern France. He rode through the battle of Mons and in
the thrilling pursuit that lead to the Aisne. His experiences
teem with exciting incidents of those never-to-be-forgotten days.
The thrill of the charge, the depression of retreat, the elation
of outwitting a clever enemy and all the little incidents of heroism,
self-sacrifice and comradeship that have become commonplaces
in the daily lives of the British Tommies, are most interestingly
described in this Oxford man's account of "Adventures
of a Despatch Rider" by permission of his publishers,
<i>Dodd, Mead and Company</i>.</p></blockquote>

I&mdash;STORIES OF THE SIGNAL OFFICE IN
NORTHERN FRANCE</h3>

<p>It had been a melancholy day, full of rain and doubting
news. Those of us who were not "out" were strolling
up and down the platform arranging the order of cakes
from home and trying to gather from the sound of the
gunning and intermittent visits to the Signal Office what
was happening.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<p>Some one had been told that the old 15th was being
hard pressed. Each of us regretted loudly that we had
not been attached to it, though our hearts spoke differently.
Despatch riders have muddled thoughts. There
is a longing for the excitement of danger and a very
earnest desire to keep away from it.</p>

<p>The C.O. walked on to the platform hurriedly, and in
a minute or two I was off. It was lucky that the road
was covered with unholy grease, that the light was bad
and there was transport on the road&mdash;for it is not good
for a despatch rider to think too much of what is before
him. My instructions were to report to the general and
make myself useful. I was also cheerfully informed
that the H.Q. of the 15th were under a robust shell-fire.
Little parties of sad-looking wounded that I passed, the
noise of the guns, and the evil dusk heartened me.</p>

<p>I rode into Festubert, which was full of noise, and,
very hastily dismounting, put my motorcycle under the
cover of an arch and reported to the general. He was
sitting at a table in the stuffy room of a particularly dirty
tavern. At the far end a fat and frightened woman was
crooning to her child. Beside her sat a wrinkled, leathery
old man with bandaged head. He had wandered into
the street, and he had been cut about by shrapnel. The
few wits he had ever possessed were gone, and he gave
every few seconds little croaks of hate. Three telephone
operators were working with strained faces at their highest
speed. The windows had been smashed by shrapnel,
and bits of glass and things crunched under foot. The
room was full of noises&mdash;the crackle of the telephones,
the crooning of the woman, the croak of the wounded old
man, the clear and incisive tones of the general and his
brigade-major, the rattle of not too distant rifles, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
booming of guns and occasionally the terrific, overwhelming
crash of a shell bursting in the village.</p>

<p>I was given a glass of wine. Cadell, the Brigade Signal
Officer, and the Veterinary Officer, came up to me
and talked cheerfully in whispered tones about our
friends.</p>

<p>There was the sharp cry of shrapnel in the street and
the sudden rattle against the whole house. The woman
and child fled somewhere through a door, followed feebly
by the old man. The brigade-major persuaded the general
to work in some less unhealthy place. The telephone
operators moved. A moment's delay as the general endeavored
to persuade the brigade-major to go first, and
we found ourselves under a stalwart arch that led into
the courtyard of the tavern. We lit pipes and cigarettes.
The crashes of bursting shells grew more frequent, and
the general remarked in a dry and injured tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"Their usual little evening shoot before putting up the
shutters, I suppose."</p>


<h3>II&mdash;"I AM WRITING UNDER SHRAPNEL FIRE"</h3>

<p>But first the Germans "searched" the village. Now
to search a village means to start at one end of the village
and place shells at discreet intervals until the other
end of the village is reached. It is an unpleasant process
for those in the middle of the village, even though they
be standing, as we were, in comparatively good shelter.</p>

<p>We heard the Germans start at the other end of the village
street. The crashes came nearer and nearer, until
a shell burst with a scream and a thunderous roar just
on our right. We puffed away at our cigarettes for a
second, and a certain despatch rider wished he were anywhere
but in the cursed village of Festubert by Béthune.
There was another scream and overwhelming relief. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
next shell burst three houses away on our left. I knocked
my pipe out and filled another.</p>

<p>The Germans finished their little evening shoot. We
marched back very slowly in the darkness to 1910 Farm.</p>

<p>This farm was neither savoury nor safe. It was built
round a courtyard which consisted of a gigantic hole
crammed with manure in all stages of unpleasant putrefaction.
One side is a barn; two sides consist of stables,
and the third is the house inhabited not only by us but
by an incredibly filthy and stinking old woman who was
continually troubling the general because some months
ago a French cuirassier took one of her chickens. The
day after we arrived at this farm I had few despatches
to take, so I wrote to Robert. Here is some of the letter
and bits of other letters I wrote during the following
days. They will give you an idea of our state of mind:</p>

<p>If you want something of the dramatic&mdash;I am writing
in a farm under shrapnel fire, smoking a pipe that was
broken by a shell. For true effect I suppose I should
not tell you that the shrapnel is bursting about fifty yards
the other side of the house, that I am in a room lying
on the floor, and consequently that, so long as they go
on firing shrapnel, I am perfectly safe.</p>

<p>It's the dismallest of places. Two miles farther back
the heavies are banging away over our heads. There are
a couple of batteries near the farm. Two miles along the
road the four battalions of our brigade are holding on for
dear life in their trenches.</p>

<p>The country is open plough, with little clumps of trees,
sparse hedges, and isolated cottages giving a precarious
cover. It's all very damp and miserable, for it was raining
hard last night and the day before.</p>

<p>I am in a little bare room with the floor covered with
straw. Two telegraph operators are making that infernal
jerky clicking sound I have begun so to hate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Half a dozen men of the signal staff are lying about the
floor looking at week-old papers. In the next room I can
hear the general, seated at a table and intent on his map,
talking to an officer that has just come from the firing
line. Outside the window a gun is making a fiendish
row, shaking the whole house. Occasionaly there is a
bit of a rattle&mdash;that's shrapnel bullets falling on the tiles
of an outhouse.</p>

<p>If you came out you might probably find this exhilarating.
I have just had a talk with our mutual friend Cadell,
the Signal Officer of this brigade, and we have decided
that we are fed up with it. For one thing&mdash;after
two months' experience of shell fire the sound of a shell
bursting within measurable distance makes you start and
shiver for a moment&mdash;reflex action of the nerves. That
is annoying. We both decided we would willingly change
places with you and take a turn at defending your doubtless
excellently executed trenches at Liberton.</p>

<p>The line to the &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> has just gone. It's almost certain
death to relay it in the daytime. Cadell and his
men are discussing the chances while somebody else has
started a musical-box. A man has gone out; I wonder
if he will come back. The rest of the men have gone to
sleep again. That gun outside the window is getting
on my nerves. Well, well!</p>

<p>The shrapnel fire appears to have stopped for the present.
No, there's a couple together. If they fire over this
farm I hope they don't send me back to D.H.Q.</p>

<p>Do you know what I long for more than anything else?
A clean, unhurried breakfast with spotless napery and
shining silver and porridge and kippers. I don't think
these long, lazy after-breakfast hours at Oxford were
wasted. They are a memory and a hope out here. The
shrapnel is getting nearer and more frequent. We are
all hoping it will kill some chickens in the courtyard.
The laws against looting are so strict.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>
<p>What an excellent musical-box, playing quite a good
imitation of <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>. I guess we shall have
to move soon. Too many shells. Too dark to write any
more&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<h3>III&mdash;HOW IT FEELS TO BE SHELLED</h3>

<p>After all, quite the most important things out here are
a fine meal and a good bath. If you consider the vast
area of the war the facts that we have lost two guns or
advanced five miles are of very little importance. War,
making one realize the hopeless insignificance of the individual,
creates in one such an immense regard for self,
that so long as one does well it matters little if four officers
have been killed reconnoitering or some wounded
have had to be left under an abandoned gun all night. I
started with an immense interest in tactics. This has
nearly all left me and I remain a more or less efficient
despatch-carrying animal&mdash;a part of a machine realizing
the hopeless, enormous size of the machine.</p>

<p>The infantry officer after two months of modern war
is a curious phenomenon.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> He is probably one of three
survivors of an original twenty-eight. He is not frightened
of being killed; he has forgotten to think about it.
But there is a sort of reflex fright. He becomes either
cautious and liable to sudden panics, or very rash indeed,
or absolutely mechanical in his actions. The first state
means the approach of a nervous breakdown, the second
a near death. There are very few, indeed, who retain
a nervous balance and a calm judgment. And all have
a harsh, frightened voice. If you came suddenly out here,
you would think they were all mortally afraid. But it
is only giving orders for hours together under a heavy
fire.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<p>Battle noises are terrific. At the present moment a
howitzer is going strong behind this, and the concussion
is tremendous. The noise is like dropping a traction-engine
on a huge tin tray. A shell passing away from you
over your head is like the loud crackling of a newspaper
close to your ear. It makes a sort of deep reverberating
crackle in the air, gradually lessening, until there
is a dull boom, and a mile or so away you see a thick
little cloud of white smoke in the air or a pear-shaped
cloud of grey-black smoke on the ground. Coming towards
you a shell makes a cutting, swishing note, gradually
getting higher and higher, louder and louder. There
is a longer note one instant and then it ceases. Shrapnel
bursting close to you has the worst sound.</p>

<p>It is almost funny in a village that is being shelled.
Things simply disappear. You are standing in an archway
a little back from the road&mdash;a shriek of shrapnel.
The windows are broken and the tiles rush clattering into
the street, while little bullets and bits of shell jump like
red-hot devils from side to side of the street, ricochetting
until their force is spent. Or a deeper bang, a crash, and
a whole house tumbles down.</p>

<p><i>&frac34;-hour later.</i>&mdash;Curious life this. Just after I had
finished the last sentence, I was called out to take a
message to a battery telling them to shell a certain village.
Here am I wandering out, taking orders for the complete
destruction of a village and probably for the death of a
couple of hundred men<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> without a thought, except that
the roads are very greasy and that lunch time is near.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>Again, yesterday, I put our Heavies in action, and in
a quarter of an hour a fine old church, with what appeared
from the distance a magnificent tower, was nothing
but a grotesque heap of ruins. The Germans were
loopholing it for defence.</p>

<p>Oh, the waste, the utter damnable waste of everything
out here&mdash;men, horses, buildings, cars, everything. Those
who talk about war being a salutary discipline are those
who remain at home. In a modern war there is little
room for picturesque gallantry or picture-book heroism.
We are all either animals or machines, with little gained
except our emotions dulled and brutalized and nightmare
flashes of scenes that cannot be written about because they
are unbelievable. I wonder what difference you will
find in us when we come home&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;A NIGHT SCARE AT THE FRONT</h3>

<p>Do you know what a night scare is? In our last H.Q.
we were all dining when suddenly there was a terrific
outburst of rifle fire from our lines. We went out into
the road that passes the farm and stood there in the pitch
darkness, wondering. The fire increased in intensity
until every soldier within five miles seemed to be revelling
in a lunatic succession of "mad minutes." Was it a
heavy attack on our lines? Soon pom-poms joined in
sharp, heavy taps&mdash;and machine guns. The lines to the
battalions were at the moment working feebly, and what
the operators could get through was scarcely intelligible.
Ammunition limbers were hurried up, and I stood ready
to dart anywhere. For twenty minutes the rifle-fire
seemed to grow wilder and wilder. At last stretcher-bearers
came in with a few wounded and reported that we
seemed to be holding our own. Satisfactory so far.
Then there were great flashes of shrapnel over our lines;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
that comforted us, for if your troops are advancing you
don't fire shrapnel over the enemy's lines. You never
know how soon they may be yours. The firing soon died
down until we heard nothing but little desultory bursts.
Finally an orderly came&mdash;the Germans had half-heartedly
charged our trenches but had been driven off with
loss. We returned to the farm and found that in the few
minutes we had been outside everything had been packed
and half-frightened men were standing about for orders.</p>

<p>The explanation of it all came later and was simple
enough. The French, without letting us know, had attacked
the Germans on our right, and the Germans to
keep us engaged had made a feint attack upon us. So
we went back to dinner.</p>

<p>In modern war the infantryman hasn't much of a
chance. Strategy nowadays consists in arranging for the
mutual slaughter of infantry by the opposing guns, each
general trusting that his guns will do the greater slaughter.
And half gunnery is luck. The day before yesterday
we had a little afternoon shoot at where we thought
the German trenches might be. The Germans unaccountably
retreated, and yesterday when we advanced
we found the trenches crammed full of dead. By a combination
of intelligent anticipation and good luck we had
hit them exactly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>From these letters you will be able to gather what mood
we were in and something of what the brigade despatch
rider was doing. After the first day the Germans ceased
shrapnelling the fields round the farm and left us nearly
in peace. There I met Major Ballard, commanding the
15th Artillery Brigade, one of the finest officers of my
acquaintance, and Captain Frost, the sole remaining officer
of the Cheshires. He was charming to me; I was
particularly grateful for the loan of a razor, for my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
had disappeared and there were no despatch riders handy
from whom I could borrow.</p>

<p>Talking of the Cheshires reminds me of a story illustrating
the troubles of a brigadier. The general was dining
calmly one night after having arranged an attack.
All orders had been sent out. Everything was complete
and ready. Suddenly there was a knock at the door and
in walked Captain M&mdash;&mdash;, who reported his arrival
with 200 reinforcements for the Cheshires, a pleasant but
irritating addition. The situation was further complicated
by the general's discovery that M&mdash;&mdash; was senior
to the officer then in command of the Cheshires. Poor
M&mdash;&mdash; was not left long in command. A fortnight
later the Germans broke through and over the Cheshires,
and M&mdash;&mdash; died where a commanding officer should.</p>


<h3>V&mdash;"I WAS SENT A MESSAGE"</h3>

<p>From 1910 Farm I had one good ride to the battalions,
through Festubert and along to the Cuinchy Bridge.
For me it was interesting because it was one of the few
times I had ridden just behind the trenches, which at
the moment were just north of the road and were occupied
by the Bedfords.</p>

<p>In a day or two we returned to Festubert, and Cadell
gave me a shake-down on a mattress in his billet&mdash;gloriously
comfortable. The room was a little draughty because
the fuse of a shrapnel had gone right through the
door and the fireplace opposite. Except for a peppering
on the walls and some broken glass the house was not
damaged; we almost laughed at the father and mother
and daughter who, returning while we were there, wept
because their home had been touched.</p>

<p>Orders came to attack. A beautiful plan was drawn
up by which the battalions of the brigade were to finish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
their victorious career in the square of La Bassée.</p>

<p>In connection with this attack I was sent with a message
for the Devons. It was the blackest of black nights
and I was riding without a light. Twice I ran into the
ditch, and finally I piled up myself and my bicycle on a
heap of stones lying by the side of the road. I did not
damage my bicycle. That was enough. I left it and
walked.</p>

<p>When I got to Cuinchy bridge I found that the Devon
headquarters had shifted. Beyond that the sentry knew
nothing. Luckily I met a Devon officer who was bringing
up ammunition. We searched the surrounding cottages
for men with knowledge, and at last discovered that the
Devons had moved farther along the canal in the direction
of La Bassée. So we set out along the towpath,
past a house that was burning fiercely enough to make
us conspicuous.</p>

<p>We felt our way about a quarter of a mile and stopped,
because we were getting near the Germans. Indeed we
could hear the rumble of their transport crossing the La
Bassée bridge. We turned back, and a few yards nearer
home some one coughed high up the bank on our right.
We found the cough to be a sentry, and behind the sentry
were the Devons.</p>

<p>The attack, as you know, was held up on the line
Cuinchy-Givenchy-Violaines; we advanced our headquarters
to a house just opposite the inn by which the
road to Givenchy turns off. It was not very safe, but
the only shell that burst anywhere near the house itself
did nothing but wound a little girl in the leg.</p>

<p>On the previous day I had ridden to Violaines at dawn
to draw a plan of the Cheshires' trenches for the general.
I strolled out by the sugar factory, and had a good
look at the red houses of La Bassée. Half an hour later
a patrol went out to explore the sugar factory. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
did not return. It seems that the factory was full of
machine guns. I had not been fired upon, because the
Germans did not wish to give their position away sooner
than was necessary.</p>

<p>A day or two later I had the happiness of avenging
my potential death. First I took orders to a battery of
6-inch howitzers at the Rue de Marais to knock the factory
to pieces, then I carried an observing officer to some
haystacks by Violaines, from which he could get a good
view of the factory. Finally I watched with supreme
satisfaction the demolition of the factory, and with regretful
joy the slaughter of the few Germans who, escaping,
scuttled for shelter in some trenches just behind
and on either side of the factory.</p>


<h3>VI&mdash;HOW THE GERMANS BROKE THROUGH</h3>

<p>I left the 15th Brigade with regret, and the regret I
felt would have been deeper if I had known what was
going to happen to the brigade. I was given interesting
work and made comfortable. No despatch rider could
wish for more.</p>

<p>Not long after I had returned from the 15th Brigade,
the Germans attacked and broke through. They had been
heavily reinforced and our tentative offensive had been
replaced by a stern and anxious defensive.</p>

<p>Now the Signal Office was established in the booking-office
of Beuvry Station. The little narrow room was
packed full of operators and vibrant with buzz and click.
The Signal Clerk sat at a table in a tiny room just off the
booking-office. Orderlies would rush in with messages,
and the Clerk would instantly decide whether to send
them by wire, by push-cyclist, or by despatch rider.
Again, he dealt with all messages that came in over the
wire. Copies of these messages were filed. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
our tape; from them we learned the news. We were not
supposed to read them, but, as we often found that they
contained information which was invaluable to despatch
riders, we always looked through them and each passed
on what he had found to the others. The Signal Clerk
might not know where a certain unit was at a given moment.
We knew, because we had put together information
that we had gathered in the course of our rides and
information which&mdash;though the Clerk might think it unimportant&mdash;supplemented
or completed or verified what
we had already obtained.</p>

<p>So the history of this partially successful attack was
known to us. Every few minutes one of us went into the
Signal Office and read the messages. When the order
came for us to pack up, we had already made our preparations,
for Divisional Headquarters, the brain controlling
the actions of seventeen thousand men, must never be
left in a position of danger. And wounded were pouring
into the Field Ambulances.</p>

<p>The enemy had made a violent attack, preluded by
heavy shelling, on the left of the 15th, and what I think
was a holding attack on the right. Violaines had been
stormed, and the Cheshires had been driven, still grimly
fighting, to beyond the Rue de Marais. The Norfolks
on their right and the K.O.S.B.'s on their left had been
compelled to draw back their line with heavy loss, for
their flanks had been uncovered by the retreat of the
Cheshires.</p>

<p>The Germans stopped a moment to consolidate their
gains. This gave us time to throw a couple of battalions
against them. After desperate fighting Rue de Marais
was retaken and some sort of line established. What
was left of the Cheshires gradually rallied in Festubert.</p>

<p>This German success, together with a later success
against the 3rd Division, that resulted in our evacuation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of Neuve Chapelle, compelled us to withdraw and readjust
our line. This second line was not so defensible
as the first. Until we were relieved the Germans battered
at it with gunnery all day and attacks all night. How we
managed to hold it is utterly beyond my understanding.
The men were dog-tired. Few of the old officers were
left, and they were "dead to the world." Never did the
Fighting Fifth more deserve the name. It fought dully
and instinctively, like a boxer who, after receiving heavy
punishment, just manages to keep himself from being
knocked out until the call of time.</p>

<p>Yet, when they had dragged themselves wearily and
blindly out of the trenches, the fighting men of the
Fighting Fifth were given but a day's rest or two before
the 15th and two battalions of the 13th were sent to
Hooge, and the remainder to hold sectors of the line farther
south. Can you wonder that we despatch riders, in
comparative safety behind the line, did all we could to
help the most glorious and amazing infantry that the
world has ever seen?<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> And when you praise the deeds
of Ypres of the First Corps, who had experienced no
La Bassée, spare a word for the men of the Fighting
Fifth who thought they could fight no more and yet
fought.</p>


<h3>VII&mdash;SPY STORIES: "THE OLD WOMAN"</h3>

<p>A few days after I had returned from the 15th Brigade
I was sent out to the 14th. I found them at the
Estaminet de l'Epinette on the Béthune-Richebourg road.
Headquarters had been compelled to shift, hastily enough,
from the Estaminet de La Bombe on the La Bassée-Estaires
road. The estaminet had been shelled to destruction
half an hour after the brigade had moved. The
Estaminet de l'Epinette was filthy and small. I slept
in a stinking barn, half-full of dirty straw, and rose with
the sun for the discomfort of it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>
<p>Opposite the estaminet a road goes to Festubert. At
the corner there is a cluster of dishevelled houses. I sat
at the door and wrote letters, and looked for what might
come to pass. In the early dawn the poplars alongside
the highway were grey and dull. There was mist on the
road; the leaves that lay thick were black. Then as the
sun rose higher the poplars began to glisten and the mist
rolled away, and the leaves were red and brown.</p>

<p>An old woman came up the road and prayed the sentry
to let her pass. He could not understand her and called
to me. She told me that her family were in the house
at the corner fifty yards distant. I replied that she could
not go to them&mdash;that they, if they were content not to
return, might come to her. But the family would not
leave their chickens, and cows, and corn. So the old
woman, who was tired, sank down by the wayside and
wept. This sorrow was no sorrow to the sorrow of the
war. I left the old woman, the sentry, and the family,
and went in to a fine breakfast.</p>

<p>At this time there was much talk about spies. Our
wires were often cut mysteriously. A sergeant had been
set upon in a lane. The enemy were finding our guns
with uncanny accuracy. All our movements seemed
to be anticipated by the enemy. Taking for granted the
extraordinary efficiency of the German Intelligence
Corps, we were particularly nervous about spies when the
Division was worn out, when things were not going
well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>


<h3>VIII&mdash;THE GIRL WHO WAS SHOT</h3>

<p>At the Estaminet de l'Epinette I heard a certain story,
and hearing it set about to make a fool of myself. This
is the story&mdash;I have never heard it substantiated, and
give it as an illustration and not as fact.</p>

<p>There was once an artillery brigade billeted in a house
two miles or so behind the lines. All the inhabitants of
the house had fled, for the village had been heavily
bombarded. Only a girl had had the courage to remain
and do hostess to the English. She was so fresh and
so charming, so clever in her cookery, and so modest
in her demeanour that all the men of the brigade headquarters
fell madly in love with her. They even quarrelled.
Now this brigade was suffering much from
espionage. The guns could not be moved without the
Germans knowing their new position. No transport or
ammunition limbers were safe from the enemy's guns.
The brigade grew mightily indignant. The girl was told
by her numerous sweethearts what was the matter. She
was angry and sympathetic, and swore that through her
the spy should be discovered. She swore the truth.</p>

<p>One night a certain lewd fellow of the baser sort pursued
the girl with importunate pleadings. She confessed
that she liked him, but not in that way. He left her and
stood sullenly by the door. The girl took a pail and
went down into the cellar to fetch up a little coal, telling
the man with gentle mockery not to be so foolish. This
angered him, and in a minute he had rushed after her into
the cellar, snorting with disappointed passion. Of course
he slipped on the stairs and fell with a crash. The girl
screamed. The fellow, his knee bruised, tried to feel his
way to the bottom of the stairs and touched a wire.
Quickly running his hand along the wire he came to a
telephone. The girl rushed to him, and, clasping his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
knees, offered him anything he might wish, if only he
would say nothing. I think he must have hesitated for a
moment, but he did not hesitate long. The girl was shot.</p>

<p>Full of this suspiciously melodramatic story I caught
sight of a mysterious document fastened by nails to the
house opposite the inn. It was covered with coloured
signs which, whatever they were, certainly did not form
letters or make sense in any way. I examined the document
closely. One sign looked like an aeroplane, another
like a house, a third like the rough drawing of a
wood. I took it to a certain officer, who agreed with
me that it appeared suspicious.</p>

<p>We carried it to the staff-captain, who pointed out
very forcibly that it had been raining lately, that colour
ran, that the signs left formed portions of letters. I
demanded the owner of the house upon which the document
had been posted. She was frightened and almost
unintelligible, but supplied the missing fragments. The
document was a crude election appeal. Being interpreted
it read something like this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
SUPPORT LEFÉVRE. HE IS NOT A LIAR LIKE DUBOIS.
</div>

<p>Talking of spies, here is another story. It is true.</p>

<p>Certain wires were always being cut. At length a
patrol was organised. While the operator was talking
there was a little click and no further acknowledgment
from the other end. The patrol started out and caught
the man in the act of cutting a second wire. He said
nothing.</p>

<p>He was brought before the Mayor. Evidence was
briefly given of his guilt. He made no protest. It was
stated that he had been born in the village. The Mayor
turned to the man and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are a traitor. It is clear. Have you anything
to say?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The man stood white and straight. Then he bowed his
head and made answer&mdash;</p>

<p>"Priez pour moi."</p>

<p>That was no defence. So they led him away.</p>


<h3>IX&mdash;TALES OF THE DESPATCH RIDERS</h3>

<p>The morning after I arrived at the 14th the Germans
concentrated their fire on a large turnip-field and exhumed
multitudinous turnips. No further damage was
done, but the field was unhealthily near the Estaminet de
l'Epinette. In the afternoon we moved our headquarters
back a mile or so to a commodious and moderately clean
farm with a forgettable name.</p>

<p>That evening two prisoners were brought in. They
owned to eighteen, but did not look more than sixteen.
The guard treated them with kindly contempt. We all
sat round a makeshift table in the loft where we slept
and told each other stories of fighting and love and fear,
while the boys, squatting a little distance away, listened
and looked at us in wonder. I came in from a ride about
one in the morning and found those of the guard who
were off duty and the two German boys sleeping side
by side. Literally it was criminal negligence&mdash;some one
ought to have been awake&mdash;but, when I saw one of the
boys was clasping tightly a packet of woodbines, I called
it something else and went to sleep.</p>

<p>A day or two later I was relieved. On the following
afternoon I was sent to Estaires to bring back some
details about the Lahore Division which had just arrived
on the line. I had, of course, seen Spahis and
Turcos and Senegalese, but when riding through Lestrem
I saw these Indian troops of ours the obvious thoughts
tumbled over one another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>We despatch riders when first we met the Indians
wondered how they would fight, how they would stand
shell-fire and the climate&mdash;but chiefly we were filled with
a sort of mental helplessness, riding among people when
we could not even vaguely guess at what they were
thinking. We could get no deeper than their appearance,
dignified and clean and well-behaved.</p>

<p>In a few days I was back again at the 14th with
Huggie. At dusk the General went out in his car to a
certain village about three miles distant. Huggie went
with him. An hour or so, and I was sent after him with
a despatch. The road was almost unrideable with the
worst sort of grease, the night was pitch-black and I was
allowed no light. I slithered along at about six miles
an hour, sticking out my legs for a permanent scaffolding.
Many troops were lying down at the side of the
road. An officer in a strained voice just warned me in
time for me to avoid a deep shell-hole by inches. I delivered
my despatch to the General. Outside the house
I found two or three officers I knew. Two of them
were young captains in command of battalions. Then I
learned how hard put to it the Division was, and what
the result is of nervous strain.</p>

<p>They had been fighting and fighting and fighting until
their nerves were nothing but a jangling torture. And a
counter-attack on Neuve Chapelle was being organised.
Huggie told me afterwards that when the car had come
along the road, all the men had jumped like startled animals
and a few had turned to take cover. Why, if a
child had met one of these men she would have taken him
by the hand instinctively and told him not to be frightened,
and defended him against anything that came.</p>

<p>First we talked about the counter-attack, and which
battalion would lead; then with a little manipulation we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
began to discuss musical comedy and the beauty of certain
ladies. Again the talk would wander back to which
battalion would lead.</p>

<p>I returned perilously with a despatch and left Huggie,
to spend a disturbed night and experience those curious
sensations which are caused by a shell bursting just
across the road from the house.</p>

<p>The proposed attack was given up. If it had been carried
out, those men would have fought as finely as they
could. I do not know whether my admiration for the
infantry or my hatred of war is the greater. I can
express neither.</p>


<h3>X&mdash;RIDING FOUR MILES ON THE DEAD LINE</h3>

<p>On the following day the Brigadier moved to a farm
farther north. It was the job of Huggie and myself to
keep up communication between this farm and the brigade
headquarters at the farm with the forgettable
name. To ride four miles or so along country lanes
from one farm to another does not sound particularly
strenuous. It was. In the first place, the neighbourhood
of the advanced farm was not healthy. The front gate
was marked down by a sniper who fired not infrequently
but a little high. Between the back gate and the main
road was impassable mud. Again, the farm was only
three-quarters of a mile behind our trenches, and "overs"
went zipping through the farm buildings at all sorts of
unexpected angles. There were German aeroplanes
about, so we covered our stationary motor-cycles with
straw.</p>

<p>Starting from brigade headquarters the despatch rider
in half a mile was forced to pass the transport of a Field
Ambulance. The men seemed to take a perverted delight
in wandering aimlessly across the road, and in leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
anything on the road which could conceivably obstruct
or annoy a motor-cyclist. Then came two and a half
miles of winding country lanes. They were covered
with grease. Every corner was blind. A particularly
sharp turn to the right and the despatch rider rode
a couple of hundred yards in front of a battery in action
that the Germans were trying to find. A "hairpin" corner
round a house followed. This he would take with
remarkable skill and alacrity, because at this corner he
was always sniped. The German's rifle was trained a
trifle high. Coming into the final straight the despatch
rider rode for all he was worth. It was unpleasant to
find new shell-holes just off the road each time you
passed, or, as you came into the straight, to hear the
shriek of shrapnel between you and the farm.</p>

<p>Huggie once arrived at the house of the "hairpin"
bend simultaneously with a shell. The shell hit the
house, the house did not hit Huggie, and the sniper forgot
to snipe. So every one was pleased.</p>

<p>On my last journey I passed a bunch of wounded
Sikhs. They were clinging to all their kit. One man
was wounded in both his feet. He was being carried by
two of his fellows. In his hands he clutched his boots.</p>

<p>The men did not know where to go or what to do. I
could not make them understand, but I tried by gestures
to show them where the ambulance was.</p>

<p>I saw two others&mdash;they were slightly wounded&mdash;talking
fiercely together. At last they grasped their rifles
firmly, and swinging round, limped back towards the
line.</p>

<p>Huggie did most of the work that day, because during
the greater part of the afternoon I was kept back
at brigade headquarters.</p>

<p>In the evening I went out in the car to fetch the general.
The car, which was old but stout, had been left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
behind by the Germans. The driver of it was a reservist
who had been taken from the battalion. Day and night
he tended and coaxed that car. He tied it together when
it fell to pieces. At all times and all places he drove
that car, for he had no wish at all to return to the
trenches.</p>

<p>On the following day Huggie and I were relieved.
When we returned to our good old musty quarters at
Beuvry men talked of a move. There were rumours of
hard fighting in Ypres. Soon the Lahore Division came
down towards our line and began to take over from us.
The 14th Brigade was left to strengthen them. The
15th and 13th began to move north.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of October 29 we started, riding
first along the canal by Béthune. As for Festubert,
Givenchy, Violaines, Rue de Marais, Quinque Rue, and
La Bassée, we never want to see them again.</p>

<p>(This despatch rider's stories are dedicated "To the
Perfect Mother&mdash;My Own." He describes "Enlisting";
"The Journey to the Front"; "The Battle of Mons";
"The Great Retreat"; "Over the Marne to the Aisne"&mdash;and
many other adventures.)</p>

I&mdash;STORY OF A DUGOUT UNDER JOHNNY
TURK'S GUNS</h3>

<div class="right">Somewhere in Turkey.<br /></div>

<p>I am sitting on a rolled-up valise, a sort of hold-all in
a dugout on a hillside, while a weary "fatigue" party
is digging more dugouts. Writing isn't easy, as I have
to balance the paper on my knee, so pardon! This little
hole in Europe (<i>i.e.</i> this dugout) appears to belong to a
Second-Lieutenant Huggins&mdash;at least, that's the name of
the valise&mdash;and taken all round it is quite a good hole
to live in. Our life has become analogous to the life
of a rabbit, and we vie with each other as to the security
of our respective burrows against the little attentions
paid us daily by the Turkish gunners. Mr. Huggins, so
far as security goes, has done well, as his lair is dug some
five feet deep and strongly built up with stone parapets.
Lying at the bottom he (or the present occupier, E. Y. P.)
would be fairly safe against either shrapnel or high
explosive. But when he lays him down to sleep I guess
Huggins will be one of the sickest soldiers on the Peninsula,
for in the left-hand a party of some 1,000,000 ants
are at this moment digging themselves in! Itchi koo! as
the song says.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>
<p>We are really reserve, resting at present, but it seems
that we have to do all the dirty work for the fellows
who have taken over our nice comfortable trenches, and
we shan't be sorry to get back into them on Sunday next.</p>

<p>The great advantage of our present position is that the
hill we are on runs down to the sea, and every day we
can get a dip, so long as we stay here. After a week or
two in the trenches we certainly <i>need</i> plenty of bathing,
and I caught two of the minor horrors of war in my
shirt yesterday. One of them (the hen-bird) won the
prize offered by one of the subalterns for the biggest
caught. Private Jones's boast that he had caught one "as
big as a mule" failed to materialise when the time for
weighing-in came. So mine (no larger than an average
mouse) won easily.</p>

<p>At this point I will break off for a lunch of bully and
biscuits.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To resume, having finished my lunch, using Mr. Huggins'
valise as a table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Away to the east, along this ridge of hills, somebody is
firing machine-guns and artillery, but as I can only see
the smoke of the shrapnel away up in the sky above the
hilltops, I don't know whether they are our guns or
Johnny Turk's. If they are his we shall soon have some
over us here, as he has picked up the Hun's habit of
having at least one daily "hate." Another shell has burst&mdash;nearer
us this time. Yes, Johnny is out for blood,
so I have moved the Huggins bundle and settled myself
on the hard, cold floor of the Palace Huggins, where the
shrapnel bullets will have more difficulty in finding me.</p>

<p>The system the gunners go on is to send an officer up a
hill to a place where he can see the countryside. He
observes through the 'scope where the places are that the
enemy troops mostly use, paths, wells, dugouts, etc., and
marks them on his map, probably numbering them
points 1, 2, 3, and so on. He also has an accurate rangefinder
and a telephone connecting him with the battery
of guns. If he sees a party of men at a certain spot, he
wires down: "Give 'em socks at point 17," or words to
that effect, and we get a few shells along, while the observing
officer scores the hits. Other days I rather suspect
he puts all the numbers into a hat and shakes them
up. Then he picks one out, and with luck the shell falls
two miles away from anyone and wipes out an ant-hill
with great slaughter.</p>

<p>He's a peculiar gentleman, old man Turk. One night
when I was going my rounds in the trenches I noticed a
general rush at a point where generally some of our
liveliest boys want suppressing, so I listened, as everyone
else seemed to be doing, and away from behind the
Turks' trenches came a sound of a band, playing some
real racy oriental music. We had quite a promenade
concert. Coming from over the rugged top of a rocky
hill and through the quiet starlit night it was quite weird,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
in a way, but we all enjoyed it. In France the Germans
often have a bit of a concert before any big attack, but
although we thought Johnny Turk might be going to do
the same, no attack came off that night. We did have a
mild attack once&mdash;see enclosed account<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>&mdash;but the enemy
never got within very exciting distance of the section of
the trench I was responsible for. Anyway, you can show
this printed account round, and tell everyone that your
son helped General Maxwell to hold the Turks back.
What! What!</p>

<h3>II&mdash;WHEN THE GENERAL VISITS THE BOYS</h3>

<p>Talking about generals: we all came out of the trenches
feeling very sorry for ourselves when we were relieved a
week ago. Certainly we were dog-tired and inexpressibly
dirty. The day following our Divisional General elected
to inspect us. Thought we to ourselves: "This means
that he is going to see what is left of us, just to see if
we are even good enough to go as a garrison to, say,
Malta." Someone even whispered "India." Certainly
no one would for one moment have suggested the possibility
of our being of the <i>least</i> use as a fighting unit
ever again. As a matter of fact, in numbers, health, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
morale we were pretty weak. The General looked on
the brighter side, however, and our dreams of Bombay
were shattered pretty quickly. The General made a
speech. He said that probably not since the days of the
Peninsular War had troops such a hard time as we had
during the past month. (We sighed solemn approval.)
We had come through well. He told us that our hardships
had apparently left us little the worse. (At this
point a private fell forward in a faint&mdash;for which piece
of acting I firmly believe he had been subsidised by his
fellow-men! The body having been ostentatiously removed,
the General continued.) There were other hard
times ahead for us, he said (exit dream of India), but
for several days yet we should continue to rest. ("Fall
in, those fifty men with picks and shovels!" came the
voice of a sergeant-major some distance away.) "And
here y'are," concluded the General, looking round at the
circle of faces ingrained with brown dust and looking
swarthy in consequence, "here y'are all looking as fit as
can be!" He ended by saying that when he had got our
reinforcements out from home he felt sure we should be
as good a fighting force as ever&mdash;which I suppose we
<i>shall</i> be. All the same, we shall have earned a rest soon,
I hope.</p>

<p>The ridge of hills we're on is very much the shape
(and nearly the height) of the Maiden Moor and Catbells
ridge. First comes a place like Eel Crags, all covered
with dugouts on the Newlands side and occupied
by hundreds of troops. Then you come on, still on the
same side, by a footpath to about the middle of Maiden
Moor. Here you will find <i>us</i>, only instead of our homes
looking down into the valley, they look down on to the
sea-shore and away out to sea, where we can see one or
two rocky islands and far away the coast of the mainland
of Turkey, a bit of Bulgaria, and a bit of Greece.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Over on the other side we can see right away down
the Peninsula and pick out all the positions you read
about in the papers. Following on the ridge, you come
to a dip before reaching the hill corresponding to Catbells,
and here is our trench, running over the saddle of
the hill. Beyond, on the slope, is the Turkish trench, and
somewhere about where that old "skeleton" is that we
used to see from the lake as we rowed to Keswick, the
Turks have their guns. They also have one beyond the
end of the ridge, about where Crossthwaite is. Well,
that gives you the general situation of our part of the
line, without saying too much.</p>

<p>The trouble at present is that they can't locate the exact
position of the Turks' big gun, which is very cleverly
hidden. The Navy, the artillery, and the airmen have
all been hunting for weeks, but so far none of them have
put it out of action, and "Striking Jimmy," as we call
him, goes on calmly dropping nine-inch high explosives
about the hills. Fortunately he doesn't often hit anything
really important (touch wood!&mdash;he's just sent a
shell in our direction).</p>

<p>I met Owen quite unexpectedly on the beach the other
day. His section is stationed some miles from here, so
I sha'n't be likely to run across him again. It was very
lucky seeing him at all. He was very busy making pumping
arrangements for the water supply, and I (as usual,
in charge of a fatigue-party) was asleep under one of
his water-tanks, when he began to curse me for being
on prohibited premises. It was quite funny! Then he
recognized me, and we had a whole afternoon together.
He's had some pretty rough times and narrow escapes,
just as I have, but we've both got so far and quite hope
to finish all safe now.</p>

<p>Don't ask me how things are going here. You, who
see the newspapers, know far more than we do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>


<h3>III&mdash;"WHISTLING WILLIE"&mdash;AND THE HUMAN
GUNS</h3>

<p>When you have lived for ten days in a region where
they wander whistling overhead, where they somersault
eccentrically in circles, where they drop bits of themselves
with the buzz of a drunken bumblebee, where, in fact,
they do everything but burst, you come to know the projectile
family fairly intimately. In fact, some poetically
constructed Bulldog has christened the various members
of the family.</p>

<p>First, there is Whistling Willie, a bustling soul, who
does his journey, between the boom of leaving his front
door and the moment when he sneezes up a cloud of dust
in front of our parapet, in about four and a half seconds.
You can almost hear him saying to the Turkish gunners:
"Now then, you chaps, come on, buck up, look alive!
That's it, off we go, <i>booooom!</i> <i>zizzzzz!</i> Here we are&mdash;tishoo!"
Yes, he's a brisk, pushing lad, is Willie, but
rather superficial really. There's more swagger and
dust about him than the result justifies&mdash;although it's
only fair to say that he once threw up a stone large
enough to upset the Adjutant's tea. Probably the war
will end (if ever) with that deed of questionable military
significance to his credit, and no more.</p>

<p>Willie's cousin, Whispering Walter, also of Ottoman
origin, is a fellow of infinitely more worth and solidity.
Though he takes longer over his trip from the muzzle to
the mark he makes up for lost time when he gets there.
It is rather as though he gave his gunners instructions to
push him off slowly so as to give him time to pick a good
place to drop. "Very good," they say to him, "off yer
goes!" <i>Booooom!</i> A pause. Then Walter comes into
our area&mdash;"<i>Whizzlizzlizzle</i>," he whispers to himself confidentially,
as much as to say, "Now <i>where</i>, down below,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
is a good fat Brigadier, or a mountain battery, or
a pile of stores (dash it, I must hurry up and spot <i>something</i>;
I'm nearly exhausted)&mdash;oh, a girls' school, a cabbage-patch&mdash;anything!"
And down he comes&mdash;<i>whang!</i>&mdash;as
often as not half a mile from anything he could damage.
There is a lesson on the futility of procrastination
in Walter's methods.</p>

<p>Walter has two brothers, Clanking Claud and Stumer
Steve. Claud always sets out, like his elder brother, in
a meditative mood. Having traveled a sufficient distance
and found nothing worthy of his mettle, he decides, apparently,
to show his independence by never coming down
from his airy height to earth at all. So "<i>Kerlank!</i>" he
says, and disappears ostentatiously in a cloud of white
smoke some fifty yards above us. True, he showers a lot
of little leaden marbles, but that merely shows his spiteful
nature.</p>

<p>And then there is poor Stumer Steve. "If ye have
tears, prepare to shed them now," for Stephen is both
blind and dumb. Though he sets out full as his brothers
of resolution, though, like Walter, he whispers promises
of daring deeds, like Claud, passes with discriminating
deliberation over the ground below, yet his final descent
is a hollow and meaningless affair, though pathetic
withal, "<i>Plunk!</i>" In a word the requiem of Steve. A
young and apparently vigorous life robbed of its final
destiny, a career despoiled of its rightful goal. Often
we find he is filled with&mdash;sawdust! Sawdust! Like any
sixpence-halfpenny doll! Sometimes he is empty altogether.
Poor Steven, the best that can be said of him,
even when in desperation he lands upon a stone and
goes hurtling away in spiral somersaults, is&mdash;"stumer,"
and even <i>that's</i> an American word!</p>

<p>Quite another kettle of fish is Greasy Gregory. There
is a solemnity, a grandeur, and a determination about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Greg that inspires respect. Also he is just about twice
the size of his fellows and takes quite twice as long in
making his way to earth. The mysterious and rather awe-inspiring
feature of his performance is that you never
hear him start! Possibly you are sitting over a slice of
bacon or a savoury, bully stew when he makes his advent
known. Just a greasy flutter overhead and then
"<i>Crash!</i>" Gregory has come.</p>

<p>Everything gets up and changes places in a cloud of
yellow dust and smoke. The atmosphere being thick,
things that have no sort of right there get into intimate
and inconvenient places (tea-pots, tunic pockets, etc.),
and I have spent as much as twenty minutes in a time of
famine separating Gallipoli Peninsula from raspberry-jam
after one of Gregory's little jokes.</p>

<p>Last, and least, comes the clown of the party&mdash;Airy
Archibald. His specialty is aeroplanes, and his efforts
are acknowledged to be purely humorous by both sides.
His methods are something like this. On some still,
cloudless afternoon a distant buzzing sound is heard,
heralding the approach of an aeroplane. Instantly Archibald
springs into life. <i>Whoop-pop!</i></p>

<p>Somewhere (it generally takes a good deal of finding)
a tiny puff of smoke appears against the blue. Never by
any chance is it in the same quarter of the sky as the aircraft.
<i>Whoop-pop!</i> <i>Whoop-pop!</i> One after another
they leap up to have a look. The airman never takes
the smallest notice, but sails serenely on, and never yet
have I seen Archibald get within a thousand yards of
his object. Once, so rumor has it, he <i>did</i> get nearer, so
near, in fact, that two of his bullets hit a wing of the
machine. But the shock of success was too great, and
Archie's empty shell falling to earth put two of his own
gunners out of action! This story I cannot vouch for,
but this I know, that after a monoplane has actually disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
over the horizon I have seen Archibald jump
viciously at him four times and every time miss him
by quite three miles! Well, here's to you, my comic
friend. You add a humor to life, and I wish the others
could follow your lead, and, taking life less seriously,
give us as wide a miss.</p>

<p>(Four weeks later, the writer of this narrative fell in
the trenches a victim of these Turkish guns.)</p>

<h2>"IN THE FIELD"&mdash;THE STORIES OF
THE FRENCH CHASSEURS</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Impressions of an Officer of Light Cavalry</i><br /><br />
<i>Told by Lieut. Marcel Dupont, of the French
Chasseurs</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>This officer of the Light Cavalry tells a straightforward story
of the charges on the battlefields of the War: "Days of misery,
days of joy, days of battle&mdash;what volumes we might write if
we were to follow our squadrons day by day. I have merely
tried to make a written record of some of the hours I have
lived through. If I should come out of the deathly struggle
safe and sound, it would be a pleasure to me some day to read
over these notes of battle and bivouac. I shall rejoice if I have
been able to revise some phases of the tragedy in which we
were the actors if my brothers-in-arms read the simple tales of
a lieutenant of Chasseurs, an unschooled effort of a soldier
more apt with the sword than with the pen." M. Dupont tells:
"How I Went to the Front," "The First Charge," "Sister Gabriel,"
and "Christmas Night." Some of these stories are here
told by permission of his publishers from his book, "In the
Field."&mdash;<i>J. B. Lippincott Company.</i></p></blockquote>

I&mdash;NIGHT IN THE HOUSE OF A PEASANT</h3>

<p>One morning in the middle of September, 1914, as
we raised our heads at about six o'clock from the straw
on which we had slept, I and my friend F. had a very
disagreeable surprise: we heard in the darkness the gentle,
monotonous noise of water falling drop by drop
from the pent-house onto the road.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<p>Arriving at Pévy the evening before, just before midnight,
we had found refuge in a house belonging to a
peasant. The hostess, a good old soul of eighty, had
placed at our disposal a small bare room paved with
tiles, in which our orderlies had prepared a sumptuous
bed of trusses of straw. The night had been delightful,
and we should have awaked in good spirits had it not
been for the distressing fact noticed by my friend.</p>

<p>"It is raining," said F.</p>

<p>I could not but agree with him. Those who have been
soldiers, and especially cavalrymen, know to the full how
dispiriting is the sound of those few words: "It is
raining."</p>

<p>"It is raining" means your clothes will be saturated;
your cloak will be drenched, and weigh at least forty
pounds; the water will drip from your shako along your
neck and down your back; above all, your high boots will
be transformed into two little pools in which your feet
paddle woefully. It means broken roads, mud splashing
you up to the eyes, horses slipping, reins stiffened, your
saddle transformed into a hip-bath. It means that the
little clean linen you have brought with you&mdash;that precious
treasure&mdash;in your saddlebags, will be changed into
a wet bundle on which large and indelible yellow stains
have been made by the soaked leather.</p>

<p>But it was no use to think of all this. The orders ran:
"Horses to be saddled, and squadron ready to mount, at
6.30." And they had to be carried out.</p>

<p>It was still dark. I went out into the yard, after pulling
down my campaigning cap over my ears. Well, after
all, the evil was less than I had feared. It was not raining,
but drizzling. The air was mild, and there was not
a breath of wind. When once our cloaks were on it
would take some hours for the wet to reach our shirts.
At the farther end of the yard some men were moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
about round a small fire. Their shadows passed to and
fro in front of the ruddy light. They were making coffee&mdash;<i>jus</i>,
as they call it&mdash;that indispensable ration in which
they soak bread and make a feast without which they
think a man cannot be a good soldier.</p>

<p>I ran to my troop through muddy alleys, skipping
from side to side to avoid the puddles. Daylight appeared,
pale and dismal. A faint smell rose from the
sodden ground.</p>

<p>"Nothing new, <i>mon Lieutenant</i>," were the words that
greeted me from the sergeant, who then made his report.
I had every confidence in him; he had been some years
in the service, and knew his business. Small and lean,
and tightly buttoned into his tunic, in spite of all our
trials he was still the typical smart light cavalry non-commissioned
officer. I knew he had already gone round
the stables, which he did with a candle in his hand, patting
the horses' haunches and looking with a watchful
eye to see whether some limb had not been hurt by a
kick or entangled in its tether.</p>

<p>In the large yard of the abandoned and pillaged farm,
where the men had been billeted they were hurrying to
fasten the last buckles and take their places in the ranks.
I quickly swallowed my portion of insipid lukewarm
coffee, brought me by my orderly; then I went to get my
orders from the Captain, who was lodged in the market-square.
No word had yet been received from the
Colonel, who was quartered at the farm of Vadiville, two
kilometres off. Patience! We had been used to these
long waits since the army had been pulled up before the
formidable line of trenches which the Germans had dug
north of Rheims. They were certainly most disheartening;
but it could not be helped, and it was of no use to
complain. I turned and went slowly up the steep footpath
that led to my billet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>


<h3>II&mdash;"I OPENED THE HEAVY DOOR&mdash;AND
ENTERED THE CHURCH"</h3>

<p>Pévy is a poor little village, clinging to the last slopes
of a line of heights that runs parallel to the road from
Rheims to Paris. Its houses are huddled together, and
seem to be grouped at the foot of the ridges for protection
from the north wind. The few alleys which intersect
the village climb steeply up the side of the hill. We
were obliged to tramp about in the sticky mud of the
main road waiting for our orders.</p>

<p>Passing the church, it occurred to me to go and look
inside. Since the war had begun we had hardly had any
opportunity of going into the village churches we had
passed. Some of them were closed because the parish
priests had left for the army, or because the village had
been abandoned to the enemy. Others had served as
marks for the artillery, and now stood in the middle
of the villages, ruins loftier and more pitiable than the
rest.</p>

<p>The church of Pévy seemed to be clinging to the side
of the hill, and was approached by a narrow stairway of
greyish stone, climbing up between moss-grown walls.
I first passed through the modest little churchyard, with
its humble tombs half hidden in the grass, and read some
of the simple inscriptions:</p>

<p>"Here lies ... Here lies ... Pray for him...."</p>

<p>The narrow pathway leading to the porch was almost
hidden in the turf, and as I walked up it my boots brushed
the drops from the grass. The damp seemed to be getting
into my bones, for it was still drizzling&mdash;a fine persistent
drizzle. Behind me the village was in mist; the roofs
and the maze of chimney tops were hardly distinguishable.</p>

<p>Passing through a low, dark porch, I opened the heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
door studded with iron nails, and entered the church, and
at once experienced a feeling of relaxation, of comfort
and repose. How touching the little sanctuary of Pévy
seemed to me in its humble simplicity!</p>

<p>Imagine a kind of hall with bare walls, the vault supported
by two rows of thick pillars. The narrow Gothic
windows hardly allowed the grey light to enter. There
were no horrible cheap modern stained windows, but a
multitude of small white rectangular leaded panes. All
this was simple and worn; but to me it seemed to breathe
a noble and touching poetry. And what charmed me
above all was that the pale light did not reveal walls
covered with the horrible colour-wash we are accustomed
to see in most of our village churches.</p>

<p>This church was an old one, a very old one. Its style
was not very well defined, for it had no doubt been built,
damaged, destroyed, rebuilt and repaired by many different
generations. But those who preserved it to the
present day had avoided the lamentable plastering which
disfigures so many others. The walls were built with
fine large stones, on which time had left its melancholy
impress. There was no grotesque painting on them to
mar their quiet beauty, and the dim light that filtered
through at that early hour gave them a vague soft glow.</p>

<p>No pictures or ornaments disfigured the walls. The
"Stations of the Cross" were the only adornment, and
they were so simple and childish in their execution that
they were no doubt the work of some rustic artist. And
even this added a touching note to a harmonious whole.</p>


<h3>III&mdash;"I KNELT&mdash;THE PRIEST WAS SAYING
MASS"</h3>

<p>But my attention was attracted by a slight noise, a kind
of soft and monotonous murmur, coming from the altar.
The choir was almost in darkness, but I could distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the six stars of the lighted candles. In front of the
tabernacle was standing a large white shadowy form,
almost motionless and like a phantom. At the bottom of
the steps another form was kneeling, bowed down
towards the floor; it did not stir as I approached. I
went towards the choir on tip-toe, very cautiously. I
felt that I, a profane person, was committing a sacrilege
by coming to disturb those two men praying there all
alone in the gloom of that sad morning. A deep feeling
of emotion passed through me, and I felt so insignificant
in their presence and in the mysterious atmosphere of
the place that I knelt down humbly, almost timidly, in
the shadow of one of the great pillars near the altar.</p>

<p>Then I could distinguish my fellow-worshippers better.
A priest was saying mass. He was young and tall, and
his gestures as he officiated were low and dignified. He
did not know that some one was present watching him
closely; so it could not be supposed that he was speaking
and acting to impress a congregation, and yet he had
a way of kneeling, of stretching out his arms and of
looking up to the humble gilded cross in front of him,
that revealed all the ardour of fervent prayers. Occasionally
he turned towards the back of the church to pronounce
the ritual words. His face was serious and
kindly, framed in a youthful beard&mdash;the face of an
apostle, with the glow of faith in his eyes. And I was
surprised to see underneath his priest's vestments the
hems of a pair of red trousers, and feet shod in large
muddy military boots.</p>

<p>The kneeling figure at the bottom of the steps now
stood out more distinctly. The man was wearing on his
shabby infantry coat the white armlet with the red cross.
He must have been a priest, for I could distinguish some
traces of a neglected tonsure among his brown hair.</p>

<p>The two repeated, in a low tone by turns, words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
prayer, comfort, repentance, or supplication, harmonious
Latin phrases, which sounded to me like exquisite music.
And as an accompaniment in the distance, in the direction
of Saint Thierry and Berry-au-Bac, the deep voice of
the guns muttered ceaselessly.</p>

<p>For the first time in the campaign I felt a kind of
poignant melancholy. For the first time I felt small and
miserable, almost a useless thing, compared with those
two fine priestly figures who were praying in the solitude
of this country church for those who had fallen and
were falling yonder under shot and shell.</p>

<p>How I despised and upbraided myself at such moments!
What a profound disgust I felt for the follies
of my garrison life, its gross pleasures and silly excesses!
I was ashamed of myself when I reflected that death
brushed by me every day, and that I might disappear
to-day or to-morrow, after so many ill-spent and unprofitable
days.</p>

<p>Without any effort, and almost in spite of myself, pious
words came back to my lips&mdash;those words that my dear
mother used to teach me on her knee years and years
ago. And I felt a quiet delight in the almost forgotten
words that came back to me:</p>

<p>"Forgive us our trespasses.... Pray for us, poor
sinners...."</p>

<p>It seemed to me that I should presently go away a
better man and a more valiant soldier. And, as though
to encourage and bless me, a faint ray of sunshine came
through the window.</p>

<p>"<i>Ite, missa est....</i>" The priest turned round; and
this time I thought his eyes rested upon me, and that
the look was a benediction and an absolution.</p>

<p>But suddenly I heard in the alley close by a great noise
of people running and horses stamping, and a voice
crying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mount horses!... Mount horses!"</p>

<p>I was sorry to leave the little church of Pévy; I should
so much have liked to wait until those two priests came
out, to speak to them, and talk about other things than
war, massacres and pillage. But duty called me to my
men, my horses, and to battle.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, as I passed at the head of my
troop in front of the large farm where the ambulance
of the division was quartered, I saw my abbé coming out
of a barn, with his sleeves tucked up and his <i>képi</i> on the
side of his head. He was carrying a large pail of milk.
I recognised his clear look, and had no doubt that he
recognised me too, for as our eyes met he gave me a
kindly smile.</p>

<p>My heart was lighter as I went forward, and my soul
was calmer.</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;"MAMAN CHEVERET"&mdash;AND THE
CAVALRYMEN</h3>

<p>For the last six days we had been quartered at Montigny-sur-Vesle,
a pretty little village half-way up a hillside
on the heights, 20 kilometres to the west of Rheims.
There we enjoyed a little rest for the first time in the
campaign. On our front the struggle was going on between
the French and German trenches, and the employment
of cavalry was impossible. All the regiment had
to do was to supply daily two troops required to ensure
the connection between the two divisions of the army
corps.</p>

<p>What a happiness it was to be able at last to enjoy
almost perfect rest! What a delight to lie down every
evening in a good bed; not to get up before seven o'clock;
to find our poor horses stabled at last on good litter in
the barns, and to see them filling out daily and getting
sleeker!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>For our mess we had the good luck to find a most
charming and simple welcome at the house of good
Monsieur Cheveret. That kind old gentleman did everything
in his power to supply us with all the comforts he
could dispose of. And he did it all with such good
grace and such a pleasant smile that we felt at ease and
at home at once. Madame Cheveret, whom we at once
called "Maman Cheveret," was an alert little old lady
who trotted about all day long in quest of things to do
for us. She put us up in the dining-room, and helped
our cook to clean the vegetables and to superintend the
joints and sweets. For Gosset, the bold Chasseur appointed
to preside over our mess arrangement, was a
professional in the culinary art, and excelled in making
everything out of nothing; so, with the help of Maman
Cheveret, he accomplished wonders, and the result of it
all was that we began to be enervated by the delights of
this new Capua. And how thoroughly we enjoyed it!</p>

<p>We shared our Eden with two other squadrons of
our regiment, a section of an artillery park, and a divisional
ambulance. We prayed Heaven to grant us a long
stay in such a haven of repose.</p>


<h3>V&mdash;THE SOLDIERS AT THE ALTAR</h3>

<p>Now one morning, after countless ablutions with hot
water and a clean shave, I was going, with brilliantly
shining boots, down the steep footpath which led to the
little house of our good Monsieur Cheveret, when my
attention was drawn to a small white notice posted on
the door of the church. It ran:</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">This Evening at Six O'clock,<br />
Benediction of the Most Holy Sacrament.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>It occurred to me at once that this happy idea had
been conceived by the Chaplain of the Ambulance, for
until then the church had been kept locked, as the young
parish priest had been called up by the mobilisation. I
made haste to tell our Captain and my comrades the
good news, and we all determined to be present at the
Benediction that evening.</p>

<p>At half-past five our ears were delighted by music
such as we had not been accustomed to hear for a very
long time. In the deepening twilight some invisible hand
was chiming the bells of the little church. How deliciously
restful they were after the loud roar of the
cannon and the rattle of the machine-guns! Who would
have thought that such deep, and also such solemn,
notes could come from so small a steeple? It stirred the
heart and brought tears to the eyes, like some of Chopin's
music. Those bells seemed to speak to us, they seemed
to call us to prayer and preach courage and virtue to us.</p>

<p>At the end of the shady walk I was passing down&mdash;whose
trees formed a rustling wall on either side&mdash;appeared
the little church, with its slender steeple. It stood
out in clear relief, a dark blue, almost violet silhouette
against the purple background made by the setting sun.
Some dark human forms were moving about and collecting
around the low arched doorway. Perhaps these were
the good old women of the district who had come to
pray in this little church which had remained closed to
them for nearly two months. I fancied I could distinguish
them from where I was, dignified and erect in
their old-fashioned mantles.</p>

<p>But as soon as I got closer to them I found I was
mistaken. It was not aged and pious women who were
hurrying to the church door, but a group of silent artillerymen
wrapped in their large blue caped cloaks. The
bells shook out their solemn notes, and seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
calling others to come too; and I should have been glad
if their voices had been heard, for I was afraid the
Chaplain's appeal would hardly be heeded and that the
benches of the little church would be three-parts
empty.</p>

<p>But on gently pushing the door open I found at once
that my fears were baseless. The church was in fact
too small to hold all the soldiers, who had come long
before the appointed hour as soon as they heard the bells
begin. And now that I had no fears about the church
being empty I wondered how I was going to find a place
myself. I stood on the doorstep, undecided, on tip-toe,
looking over the heads of all those standing men to see
whether there was any corner unoccupied where I could
enjoy the beauty of the unexpected sight in peace.</p>

<p>The nave was almost dark. The expense of lighting
had no doubt to be considered, for for several days past
no candle or taper was to be had for money. And no
doubt the kindness of a motorist of the Red Cross had
been appealed to for the supply of all the candles which
lit up the altar. This was indeed resplendent. The
vestry had been ransacked for candlesticks, and the
tabernacle was surrounded by a splendid aureole of light.
All this increased the touching impression I felt on
entering.</p>

<p>Against the brilliant background of the choir stood out
the black forms of several hundreds of men standing and
looking towards the altar. Absolute silence reigned over
the whole congregation of soldiers. And yet no discipline
was enforced; there was no superior present to
impose a show of devotion. Left to themselves, they all
understood what they had to do. They crowded together,
waiting in silence and without any impatience for the
ceremony to begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI&mdash;ARTILLERYMEN AT HOLY COMMUNION</h3>

<p>Suddenly a white figure came towards me through the
crowded ranks of soldiers. He extended his arms in
token of welcome, and I at once recognised the Chaplain
in his surplice. His face was beaming with pleasure, and
his eyes shone behind his spectacles. He appeared to be
supremely happy.</p>

<p>"This way, <i>Monsieur l'Officier</i>, this way. I have
thought of everything. You must have the seat of
honour. Follow me."</p>

<p>I followed the holy man, who elbowed a way for me
up the crowded aisle. He had reserved all the choir-stalls
for the officers. Before the war they had been
occupied, at high mass, by the clergy, the choir, and the
principal members of the congregation. He proudly
showed me into one of them, and I felt rather embarrassed
at finding myself suddenly in a blaze of light
between an artillery lieutenant and a surgeon-major.</p>

<p>The low vestry door now opened and a very unexpected
procession appeared. In front of a bearded priest
walked four artillerymen in uniform. One of them carried
a censer, and another the incense-box. The other
two walked in front of them, arms crossed and eyes
front. The whole procession knelt before the altar with
perfect precision, and I saw beneath the priest's vestments
muddy gaiters of the same kind as those worn by
the gunners.</p>

<p>At the same time we heard, quite close to us, strains
of music which seemed to us celestial. In the dim light
I had not noticed the harmonium, but now I could distinguish
the artist who was enchanting us by his skill in
drawing sweet sounds from a poor worn instrument. He
was an artillery captain. At once all eyes were turned
towards him; we were all enraptured. None of us dared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to hope that we should lift our voices in the hymns.</p>

<p>The organist seemed unconscious of his surroundings.
The candle placed near the keyboard cast a strange light
upon the most expressive of heads. Against the dark
background of the church the striking features of a noble
face were thrown into strong relief: a forehead broad
and refined, an aristocratic nose, a fair moustache turned
up at the ends, and, notably, two fine blue eyes, which,
without a glance at the fingers on the keys, were fixed on
the vaulted roof as though seeking inspiration there.</p>

<p>The Chaplain, turning to the congregation, then said:</p>

<p>"My friends, we will all join in singing the <i>O Salutaris</i>."</p>

<p>The harmonium gave the first notes, and I braced myself
to endure the dreadful discords I expected from this
crowd of soldiers&mdash;mostly reservists&mdash;who, I supposed,
had come together that evening mainly out of curiosity.</p>

<p>Judge of my astonishment! At first only a few timid
voices joined the Chaplain's. But after a minute or so a
marvel happened. From all those chests came a volume
of sound such as I could hardly have believed possible.
Who will say then that our dear France has lost her
Faith? Who can believe it? Every one of these men
joined in singing the hymn, and not one of them seemed
ignorant of the Latin words. It was a magnificent choir,
under a lofty vault, chanting with the fervour of absolute
sincerity. There was not one discordant note, not
one voice out of tune, to spoil its perfect harmony.</p>

<p>Who can believe that men, many of them more than
thirty years old, would remember all the words unless
they had been brought up in the faith of their ancestors
and still held it?</p>

<p>I could not help turning to look at them. In the light
of the candles their faces appeared to be wonderfully
transfigured. Not one of them expressed irony or even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
indifference. What a fine picture it would have made for
a Rembrandt! The bodies of the men were invisible
in the darkness of the nave, and their heads alone
emerged from the gloom. The effect was grand enough
to fascinate the most sceptical of painters; it soothed and
charmed one and wiped out all the miseries that the war
had left in its wake. Men like these would be equal to
anything, ready for anything; and I myself should much
have liked to see a Monsieur Homais hidden away in
some corner of that church.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sacred Office was proceeding at the
altar. At any other time we might have smiled at the
sight of that soldier-priest served by choristers of thirty-five
in uniform; at that ceremony it was inexpressibly
touching and attractive, and it was especially delightful
to see how carefully and precisely each performed his
function that the ceremony might not lack its accustomed
pomp.</p>


<h3>VII&mdash;THE WARRIORS AND THE ROSARY</h3>

<p>When the singing had ceased the Chaplain went up to
the holy table. In a voice full of feeling he tried to
express his gratitude and happiness to all those brave
fellows. I should not imagine him to be a brilliant
speaker at the best of times, but on that occasion the
worthy man was completely unintelligible. His happiness
was choking him. He tried in vain to find the words
he wanted, used the wrong ones, and only confused himself
by trying to get them right. But nobody had the
least desire to laugh when, to conclude his address, he
said with a sigh of relief:</p>

<p>"And now we will tell twenty beads of the rosary;
ten for the success of our arms, and the other ten in
memory of soldiers who have died on the field of honour....
<i>Hail! Mary, full of grace....</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked round the church once more, and every one's
lips were moving silently accompanying the priest's
words. Opposite us I saw the artillery captain take a
rosary out of his pocket and tell the beads with dreamy
eyes; and when the Chaplain came to the sentence "Holy
Mary, Mother of God, ..." hundreds of voices burst
forth, deep and manly voices, full of fervour which
seemed to proclaim their faith in Him Who was present
before them on the altar, and also to promise self-sacrifice
and devotion to that other sacred thing, their
Country.</p>

<p>Then, after the <i>Tantum ergo</i> had been sung with
vigour, the priest held up the monstrance, and I saw
all those soldiers with one accord kneel down on the
stone floor and bow their heads. The silence was impressive;
not a word, not a cough, and not a chair moved.
I had never seen such devotion in any church. Some
spiritual power was brooding over the assemblage and
bowing all those heads in token of submission and hope.
Good, brave soldiers of France, how we love and honour
you at such moments, and what confidence your chiefs
must feel when they lead such men to battle!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We sat at table around the lamp, and good Maman
Cheveret had just brought in the steaming soup. Right
away towards the east we heard the dull roll of the
cannon. Good Monsieur Cheveret had just brought up
from his cellar a venerable bottle of his best Burgundy,
and, at the invitation of the Captain, he sat down to
drink a glass with us, smoking his cherry-wood pipe and
listening with delight to our merry chat.</p>

<p>Gosset was in his kitchen next door preparing a delicious
piece of beef <i>à la mode</i> and at the same time telling
Maman Cheveret about his exploits of the past month.</p>

<p>We heard the men of the first troop cracking their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
jokes in the yard as they ate their rations and emptied
their pannikin of wine under a brilliant moon.</p>

<p>Down in the valley on the banks of the murmuring
Vesle, songs and laughter floated up to us from the
artillery park.</p>

<p>And the village itself, shining under the starlit sky,
seemed bathed in an atmosphere of cheerfulness, courage
and confidence.</p>

<h2>"FIELD HOSPITAL AND FLYING
COLUMN"&mdash;IN RUSSIA</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Journal of an English Nursing Sister</i><br /><br />
<i>Told by Violetta Thurstan</i>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>This English woman relates her experiences as an eye witness
and participant. "For me," she says, "the beginning of the War
was a torchlight tattoo on Salisbury Plain. It was fascinating
to watch the stately entrance into the field of Lancers, Irish
Rifles, Welsh Fusiliers, Grenadiers and many another gallant
regiment, each marching into the field in turn to the swing of
their own particular regimental tune until they were all drawn
up in order." She then tells about "The Beginning of It All";
"Her Experiences in Charleroi and Roundabout"; "The Return
to Brussels"; "Our Work in Warsaw"; "The Bombardment of
Lodz," and "The Trenches at Radzivilow." These and many
other stories have been collected into a volume under the title
"Field Hospital and Flying Column." The stories told here

I&mdash;WITH GRAND DUCHESS CYRIL IN
WARSAW</h3>

<p>The Grand Duchess Cyril happened to be staying at
the Hotel Bristol too. Like most of the other members
of the Russian Royal Family, since the beginning of the
war she has been devoting her whole time to helping
wounded soldiers, and is the center of a whole network
of activities. She has a large hospital in Warsaw for
men and officers, a very efficient ambulance train that
can hold 800 wounded, and one of the best surgeons in
Petrograd working on it, and a provision train which
sets up feeding-stations for the troops and for refugees
in places where food is very scarce, which last is an indescribable
boon to all who benefit by it. The Grand
Duchess's hospital in Warsaw, like every other just at
this time, was crammed to overflowing with wounded
from Lodz, and the staff was inadequate to meet this unexpected
need.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>
<p>The Grand Duchess met Princess V. in the lounge
just as we arrived from Lodz, and begged that our Column
might go and help for a time at her hospital. Accordingly,
the next day, the consent of the Red Cross
Office having been obtained, we went off to the Grand
Duchess's hospital for a time to supplement and relieve
their staff. They met us with open arms, as they were
all very tired and very thankful for our help. They
only had room for fifty patients and had had about 150
brought in. Fortunately the Grand Duchess's ambulance
train had just come back to Warsaw, so the most convalescent
of the old cases were taken off to Petrograd,
but even then we were working in the operating-theater
till twelve or one every night. They hoped we had come
for two or three weeks and were very disgusted when,
in five days' time, the order came for us to go off to
Skiernevice with the automobiles. The hospital staff
gave us such a nice send-off, and openly wished that
they belonged to a flying column too. I must say it was
very interesting these startings off into the unknown,
with our little fleet of automobiles containing ourselves
and our equipment. We made a very flourishing start out
of Warsaw, but very soon plunged into an appalling mess
of mud. One could really write an epic poem on Russian
roads. At the best of times they are awful; on this
particular occasion they were full of large holes made
by shells and covered with thick, swampy mud that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
been snow the week before. It delayed us so much that
we did not get to Skiernevice till late that night.</p>


<h3>II&mdash;CAMPING IN THE TZAR'S SHOOTING BOX</h3>

<p>Skiernevice is a small town, important chiefly as a
railway junction, as two lines branch off here towards
Germany and Austria northwest and southwest. The
Tsar has a shooting-box here in the midst of beautiful
woods, and two rooms had been set apart in this house
for our Column.</p>

<p>We arrived late in the evening, secretly hoping that
we should get a night in bed, and were rather rejoiced
at finding that there were no wounded there at all at
present, though a large contingent was expected later.
So we camped in the two rooms allotted to us: Princess,
Sister G., and myself in one, and all the men of the
party in the other. No wounded arrived for two or
three days, and we thoroughly enjoyed the rest and,
above all, the beautiful woods. How delicious the pines
smelt after that horrible Lodz. Twice a day we used
to go down the railway line, where there was a restaurant
car for the officers; it seemed odd to be eating our
meals in the Berlin-Warsaw International Restaurant
Car. There was always something interesting going on
at the station. One day a regiment from Warsaw had
just been detrained there when a German Taube came
sailing over the station throwing down grenades. Every
man immediately began to fire up in the air, and we ran
much more risk of being killed by a Russian bullet than
by the German Taube. It was like being in the middle
of a battle, and I much regretted I had not my camera
with me. Another day all the débris of a battlefield had
been picked up and was lying in piles in the station waiting
to be sent off to Warsaw. There were truck-loads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of stuff; German and Russian overcoats, boots, rifles,
water-bottles, caps, swords, and helmets and all sorts
of miscellaneous kit.</p>

<p>We often saw gangs of prisoners, mostly Austrian,
but some German, and they always seemed well treated
by the Russians. The Austrian prisoners nearly always
looked very miserable, cold, hungry, and worn out. Once
we saw a spy being put into the train to go to Warsaw,
I suppose to be shot&mdash;an old Jewish man with white hair
in a long, black gaberdine, strips of colored paper still
in his hand with which he had been caught signaling to
the Germans. <i>How</i> angry the soldiers were with him&mdash;one
gave him a great punch in the back, another kicked
him up into the train, and a soldier on the platform who
saw what was happening ran as fast as he could and
was just in time to give him a parting hit on the shoulder.
The old man did not cry out or attempt to retaliate;
but his face was ashy-white with terror, and one of his
hands was dripping with blood. It was a very horrible
sight and haunted me all the rest of the day. It was
quite right that he should be shot as a spy, but the unnecessary
cruelty first sickened me.</p>

<p>There were masses of troops constantly going up to
the positions from Skiernevice, and as there was a short
cut through the park, which they generally used, we
could see all that was going on from our rooms. On
Sunday it was evident that another big battle was pending.
Several batteries went up through our woods, each
gun-carriage almost up to its axles in mud, dragged by
eight strong horses. They were followed by a regiment
of Cossacks, looking very fierce in their great black fur
head-dresses, huge sheep-skin coats, and long spears.
There was one small Cossack boy who was riding out
with his father to the front and who could not have been
more than eleven or twelve years old. There are quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
a number of young boys at the front who make themselves
very useful in taking messages, carrying ammunition,
and so on. We had one little boy of thirteen in
the hospital at Warsaw, who was badly wounded while
carrying a message to the colonel, and he was afterwards
awarded the St. George's Cross.</p>

<p>There were enormous numbers of other troops too:
Siberians, Tartars, Asiatic Russians from Turkestan,
Caucasians in their beautiful black-and-silver uniforms,
Little Russians from the south, and great fair-haired
giants from the north.</p>

<p>The little Catholic Church in the village was full to
overflowing at the early Mass that Sunday morning with
men in full marching kit on their way out to the trenches.
A very large number of them made their Confession and
received the Blessed Sacrament before starting out, and
for many, many of these it was their Viaticum, for the
great battle began that afternoon, and few of the gallant
fellows we saw going up to the trenches that morning
ever returned again.</p>

<p>That afternoon the Prince had business at the Staff
Headquarters out beyond Lowice, and I went out there
in the automobile with him and Monsieur Goochkoff.
We went through Lowice on the way there. The little
town had been severely bombarded (it was taken two
or three days later by the Germans), and we met many
of the peasants hurrying away from it carrying their
possessions with them. You may know the peasants of
Lowice anywhere by their distinctive dress, which is the
most brilliantly colored peasant dress imaginable. The
women wear gorgeous petticoats of orange, red and blue,
or green in vertical stripes and a cape of the same material
over their shoulders, a bright-colored shawl, generally
orange, on their heads, and brilliant bootlaces&mdash;magenta
is the color most affected. The men, too, wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
trousers of the same kind of vertical stripes, generally
of orange and black. These splashes of bright color
are delicious in this sad, gray country.</p>


<h3>III&mdash;THE GENERAL STAFF AT RADZIVILOW
CASTLE</h3>

<p>The General of the Staff was quartered at Radzivilow
Castle, and I explored the place while the Prince and
Monsieur Goochkoff did their business. The old, dark
hall, with armor hanging on the walls and worm-eaten
furniture covered with priceless tapestry, would have
made a splendid picture. A huge log fire burning on
the open hearth lighted up the dark faces of the two
Turkestan soldiers who were standing on guard at the
door. In one corner a young lieutenant was taking interminable
messages from the field telephone, and under
the window another Turkestan soldier stood sharpening
his dagger. The Prince asked him what he was doing,
and his dark face lighted up. "Every night at eight,"
he said, still sharpening busily, "I go out and kill some
Germans." The men of this Turkestan regiment are said
to be extraordinarily brave men. They do not care at
all about a rifle, but prefer to be at closer quarters with
the enemy with their two-edged dagger, and the Germans
like them as little as they like our own Gurkhas and
Sikhs.</p>

<p>The next day the wounded began to arrive in Skiernevice,
and in two days' time the temporary hospital was
full.</p>

<p>The Tsar had a private theater at Skiernevice with a
little separate station of its own about 200 yards farther
down the line than the ordinary station, and in many
ways this made quite a suitable hospital except for the
want of a proper water-supply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>The next thing we heard was that the Russian General
had decided to fall back once more, and we must be
prepared to move at any moment.</p>

<p>All that day we heard violent cannonading going on
and all the next night, though the hospital was already
full, the little country carts came in one after another
filled with wounded. They were to only stay one night,
as in the morning ambulance trains were coming to take
them all away, and we had orders to follow as soon as
the last patient had gone. Another operating- and dressing-room
was quickly improvised, but even with the two
going hard all night it was difficult to keep pace with
the number brought in.</p>

<p>The scenery had never been taken down after the last
dramatic performance played in the theater, and wounded
men lay everywhere between the wings and drop scenes.
The auditorium was packed so closely that you could
hardly get between the men without treading on some
one's hands and feet as they lay on the floor. The light
had given out&mdash;in the two dressing-rooms there were
oil-lamps, but in the rest of the place we had to make do
with candle-ends stuck into bottles. The foyer had been
made into a splendid kitchen, where hot tea and boiling
soup could be got all night through. This department
was worked by the local Red Cross Society, and was
a great credit to them.</p>

<p>About eight o'clock in the morning the first ambulance
train came in, and was quickly filled with patients. We
heard that the Germans were now very near, and hoped
we should manage to get away all the wounded before
they arrived.</p>

<p>The second train came up about eleven, and by that
time a fierce rifle encounter was going on. From the
hospital window we could see the Russian troops firing
from the trenches near the railway. Soon there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
violent explosion that shook the place; this was the Russians
blowing up the railway bridge on the western side
of the station.</p>

<p>The second train went off, and there were very few
patients left now, though some were still being brought
in at intervals by the Red Cross carts. Our automobiles
had started off to Warsaw with some wounded officers,
but the rest of the column had orders to go to
Zyradow by the last train to leave Skiernevice.</p>

<p>The sanitars now began to pack up the hospital; we
did not mean to leave anything behind for the enemy if
we could help it. The few bedsteads were taken to
pieces and tied up, the stretchers put together and the
blankets tied up in bundles. When the last ambulance
train came up about 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the patients were first put
in, and then every portable object that could be removed
was packed into the train too. At the last moment, when
the train was just about to start, one of the sanitars
ran back and triumphantly brought out a pile of dirty
soup plates to add to the collection. Nothing was left
in the hospital but two dead men we had not time to
bury.</p>

<p>The wounded were all going to Warsaw and the other
Russian Sisters went on in the train with them. But
our destination was Zyradow, only the next station but
one down the line.</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;ADVENTURES OF A PRINCESS IN POLAND</h3>

<p>When we arrived at Zyradow about three o'clock we
were looking forward to a bath and tea and bed, as we
had been up all night and were very tired; but the train
most unkindly dropped us about a quarter of a mile
from the station, and we had to get out all our equipment
and heavy cases of dressings, and put them at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the side of the line, while Julian, the Prince's soldier
servant, went off to try and find a man and a cart for
the things. There was a steady downpour of rain, and
we were soaked by the time he came back saying that
there was nothing to be had at all. The station was all
in crumbling ruins, so we could not leave the things
there, and our precious dressings were beginning to get
wet. Finally we got permission to put them in a closed
cinema theater near the station, but it was dark by that
time, and we were wet and cold and began once more to
center our thoughts on baths and tea. We were a small
party&mdash;only six of us&mdash;Princess, we two Sisters, Colonel
S., a Russian dresser, and Julian. We caught a local
Red Crosser. "Where is the hotel?" "There is no
hotel here." "Where can we lodge for to-night?" "I
don't know where you could lodge." "Where is the Red
Cross Bureau?" asked Princess, in desperation. "About
a quarter of an hour's walk. I will show you the way."</p>

<p>We got to the Red Cross Bureau to find that Monsieur
Goochkoff had not yet arrived, though he was expected,
and they could offer no solution of our difficulties, except
to advise us to go to the Factory Hospital and see if
they could make any arrangement for us. The Matron
there was <i>very</i> kind, and telephoned to every one she
could think of, and finally got a message that we were
expected, and were to sleep at the Reserve. So we
trudged once more through the mud and rain. The "Reserve"
was two small, empty rooms, where thirty Sisters
were going to pass the night. They had no beds,
and not even straw, but were just going to lie on the
floor in their clothes. There was obviously no room
for six more of us, and finally we went back once more
to the Red Cross Bureau. Princess seized an empty
room, and announced that we were going to sleep in it.
We were told we couldn't, as it had been reserved for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
somebody else; but we didn't care, and got some patients'
stretchers from the depot and lay down on them in our
wet clothes just as we were. In the middle of the night
the "somebody" for whom the room had been kept arrived,
strode into the room, and turned up the electric
light. The others were really asleep, and I pretended
to be. He had a good look at us, and then strode out
again grunting. We woke up every five minutes, it was
so dreadfully cold, and though we were so tired, I was
not sorry when it was time to get up.</p>

<p>We had breakfast at a dirty little restaurant in the
town, and then got a message from the Red Cross that
there would be nothing for us to do that day, but that
we were probably going to be sent to Radzowill the following
morning. So we decided to go off to the Factory
Hospital and see if we could persuade the Matron to
let us have a bath there.</p>

<p>Zyradow is one very large cotton and woollen factory,
employing about 5,000 hands. In Russia it is the good
law that for every hundred workmen employed there
shall be one hospital bed provided. In the small factories
a few beds in the local hospital are generally subsidized,
in larger ones they usually find it more convenient
to have their own. So here there was a very nice
little hospital with fifty beds, which had been stretched
now to hold twice as many more, as a great many
wounded had to be sent in here. The Matron is a Pole
of Scottish extraction, and spoke fluent but quite foreign
English with a strong Scotch accent. There are a
good many Scotch families here, who came over and
settled in Poland about a hundred years ago, and who
are all engaged in different departments in the factory.
She was kindness itself, and gave us tea first and then
prepared a hot bath for us all in turn. We got rid of
most of our tormentors and were at peace once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>As we left the hospital we met three footsore soldiers
whose boots were absolutely worn right through. They
were coming up to the hospital to see if the Matron had
any dead men's boots that would fit them. It sounded
rather gruesome&mdash;but she told us that that was quite a
common errand. The Russian military boots are excellent,
but, of course, all boots wear out very quickly
under such trying circumstances of roads and weather.
They are top boots, strong and waterproof, and very
often made by the men themselves. The uniform, too,
is very practical and so strong that the men have told
me that carpets are made from the material. The color
is browner than our own khaki&mdash;and quite different both
from the German, which is much grayer, and the Austrian,
which is almost blue. I heard in Belgium that at
the beginning of the war German soldiers were constantly
mistaken for our men.</p>

<h2>AN UNCENSORED DIARY&mdash;FROM
THE CENTRAL EMPIRES</h2>

<div class="center"><i>By Ernesta Drinker Bullitt, An American Woman in
the Diplomatic Circles in Germany and Austria</i>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>This is one of the most delightfully interesting narratives in
the entire War. It is the diary of an American woman with a
charming sense of humor. Mrs. Bullitt accompanied her husband
on his interviews with the diplomatists as special correspondent
with the <i>Philadelphia Public Ledger</i>. Her conversations
with historical personages give one an intimate acquaintanceship
with the great characters in the world's tragedy.
This American woman tells how she dined with von Bissing,
Governor of Belgium; Zimmerman, "the busiest man in the
German Empire," discussed the War with her; Countess von
Bernstorff and Baroness von Bissing asked her to tea; ambassadors
and statesmen parleyed with her. She recorded her
daily experiences without any thought of their future publication.
It stands unique as a record written entirely within the
lines of the Central Empires. Brilliant sketches from this diary
are here reprinted by the authority of the publishers: <i>Doubleday,
Page and Company</i>: Copyright 1917.</p></blockquote>


<h3>I&mdash;WITH LETTERS FROM COUNT
BERNSTORFF</h3>

<div class="right"><i>Copenhagen, May 14, 1916.</i><br /></div>

<p>Once upon a time ... before the war, one went
abroad with no more preparation than a steamer ticket
and an American Express check or two. Two days ago,
we undertook to go from Holland to Denmark, via Germany.
Before daring to approach Bentheim, the German
frontier, we were equipped with passports, thrice viséd;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
a special letter of identification from the Department of
State, birth certificates, letters to the frontier authorities
from Count Bernstorff and the German Minister at The
Hague, eighty-seven other letters of introduction, two
letters of credit, and a Philadelphia police card....</p>


<h3>II&mdash;AT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN
COPENHAGEN</h3>

<div class="right"><i>May 23d.</i><br /></div>

<p>Denmark is hospitable, inexpensive, and friendly. We
have seen the Egans frequently. They have been more
than kind. Mr. Egan has been in Denmark eleven years&mdash;a
longer period than any other diplomat in our service
to-day has held a post. By common consent, he is the
most popular diplomat in Denmark. The other Ministers
keep dashing in and out, getting advice from Mr.
Egan....</p>

<p>Among the other qualities of a perfect diplomat which
Mr. and Mrs. Egan possess, they have that of never
making a "break." Therefore, they gave us (principally
me) what we needed&mdash;advice as to caution in speech, behavior,
facial expression, and etiquette, also warning us
against writing anything down on paper. It's going to
be hard on me. I never was born to be indefinite. I am
practising conversing diplomatically.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bullitt, Verdun has been taken and Paris is about
to surrender."</p>

<p>"Really? How curious. Battles are so interesting,
aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bullitt, if it were not for American ammunition,
the war would have ended in six months."</p>

<p>"Yes, battles <i>are</i> dangerous, aren't they?" Whereas,
I <i>might</i> mention our Spanish war and certain famous
German munition factories. So, the crest of idiotic amiability
being reached, we move on to the weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Count Szechenyi, the Austro-Hungarian Minister,
thinks it would be a good plan for us to go to Vienna
and Pest, as so little has been seen of them during the
war. He has very kindly written to people there that we
are coming. I played tennis with him this afternoon at
the club, he in his suspenders and monocle, and I in
street clothes, with a pair of borrowed tennis shoes two
inches too long on my feet, and a racket like a spoon, as
a means of defence, in my hand....</p>


<h3>III&mdash;WITH AMBASSADOR GERARD IN BERLIN</h3>

<div class="right"><i>Hotel Esplanade, Berlin, May 29th.</i><br /></div>

<p>We got to Berlin. I must say I should have liked to
wrap up in the American flag and sleep on Mr. Gerard's
doorstep myself. The inspection this time was really too
disgusting to repeat. I decided that, if I ever again heard
any one say: "It's our orders," I should kill him. Orders
apparently mean: Be as nasty to the man who can't
hit you back as your imagination will allow....</p>

<p>We lunched at the Embassy the day after we got here.
Mrs. Gerard is charming and Mr. Gerard one of the most
amusing men I ever met. Brusque, frank, quick-witted,
a typically judicial mind, and a typically undiplomatic
manner, he is the last person in the world a German
would understand. His dry, slangy, American humor,
his sudden lapses into the comic in moments of solemnity,
his irreverence for the great, shock the worthy German.
That he treats the Emperor in any other way than as a
business acquaintance is most unlikely....</p>

<p>The Embassy is filled with Harvard secretaries, whose
lips, as Mr. Egan says, are still wet with the milk of
Groton. The ballroom is bulging with stenographers.
Never did the world see its few remaining diplomats so
overworked. Instead of coming down and reading the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
papers for two hours a day, they now all work mornings,
afternoons, and sometimes evenings.</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;AT TEA WITH BARON ROEDER</h3>

<div class="right">
<i>June 3d.</i>
</div>

<p>To-day, the flags are all out for the naval victory, even
the trams and buses are decorated. The Germans didn't
wish to celebrate until they were quite sure. They've
made one or two mistakes, so they were cautious this
time. The school-children take a real interest in German
victories. They get a holiday on the strength of one,
and they measure the victory only by the length of their
holiday. The joy is slightly adulterated by having to go
to school first and listen to a careful explanation of what
they are about to celebrate. Their fondness for Hindenburg
is quite immoderate. In the eyes of German children,
a campaign against the Russians is a most praiseworthy
undertaking.</p>

<p>The great wooden statue of Hindenburg, encased in
geranium plants and scaffolding, had many nails driven
into it to-day. The statue is an unsightly thing, but it
seems to appeal to the Berliners to buy a nail for the
benefit of the Red Cross, climb the scaffolding, and hammer
it in....</p>

<p>Lunched with the Jacksons. Mr. Jackson was Secretary
of the Embassy here for years. The Germans trust
him, Baron von Mumm told me. Baron and Baroness
Roeder were there and Countess Götzen. I asked Baron
Roeder what he did and he said he was Master of Ceremonies
at Court, and official introducer, and a lot of other
things. He is about seventy-five, but he says he is going
to the front if the war keeps up much longer. Already
he has offered himself three times. His chief irritation
against England is being cut off from his London tailor.
Every German I meet out of uniform tells the same sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
tale. The old gentleman said he thought the naval victory
was due principally to Zeppelins. The Blüchers
joined us for coffee. Count Blücher looks like the pictures
of his famous grandparent. Princess &mdash;&mdash; said
that his father is a dreadful old gentleman, fights with
everyone, his son included, all the time. As the old
Prince is eighty-five, the relations had better run around
and turn the other cheek before it's too late.</p>


<h3>V&mdash;COUNTESS &mdash;&mdash; AND HER DAUGHTER</h3>

<div class="right">
<i>June 4th.</i>
</div>

<p>We staggered in to Countess &mdash;&mdash;'s tea late in the
afternoon. She told me how she brought up Hilda, her
daughter. Hilda is a little matter of six feet high.
Her mother was afraid to ever let her daughter
go up in the hotel lift alone for fear something will happen
to her. As her last offence was to refuse to let the
Kaiser kiss her&mdash;he being her godfather and claiming
parental privileges&mdash;it would seem she could take care
of herself.</p>


<h3>VI&mdash;DINNER WITH COUNTESS GOTZEN</h3>

<div class="right">
<i>June 8th.</i>
</div>

<p>I met Countess Blücher talking to that mad Irish-American,
John Gaffney. He was removed from his
consulship at Munich for being un-neutral, so now he
is in a white rage at the President. He says he is the
only American who has been fair to the Germans and
that he never was un-neutral. Both Countess Blücher
and Gaffney were in a great state of mind over Casement.
Gaffney says he is a hero who sacrificed himself
for his country, and Countess Blücher that he is a lifelong
friend and therefore must be got off from hanging,
whatever he has done. She has written a letter to
England, saying Casement is mad, in hope that it may
help to save him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't fancy he will like that&mdash;coming from me,"
she said, "but it was the only thing I could think of doing."</p>

<p>I asked Count Blücher when he thought the war would
end, and he said: "When Russia is spent." I said that
sounded rather pessimistic.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I think we can wear her out and then
get a port on the Baltic...."</p>

<p>Dined last night with Countess Götzen. I sat between
a Spaniard and Prince Christian of Hesse. The Spaniard
was a detestable little thing, and Prince Christian
had tonsilitis and thought he was going to die, so I didn't
get much entertainment out of him, either. Later on we
changed seats and I drew a fat and pleasant Bavarian,
who had known my aunt in America. I asked him what
his name was and he said they called him "Booby." I
said I might get to that in time but I had to have something
else to tide me over. After a few Christian names,
I ran him down to his visiting card and Baron von Papius.</p>

<p>Had tea with Countess Sehr-Thoss, an American. She
is charming. When I admired an old painting on her
drawing-room wall, she said: "Yes. I bought that with
2,000 marks sent me by my old uncle to buy eggs. He
wrote he heard in America we were paying five dollars
apiece for eggs and thought I might not be able to afford
them!"</p>

<p>The Duchess of Croy came bounding in, looking most
exuberant and American. I liked her, she is so unaffected....</p>


<h3>VII&mdash;WHEN THE CZARINA BURST INTO
TEARS</h3>

<div class="right">
<i>June 10th.</i>
</div>

<p>Saw Fräulein Marelle and Fräulein Schulhoff, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Lyceum Club, this morning. They were telling us stories
of the invasion of East Prussia.... One lady, whom
Fräulein Marelle knows, a Frau von Bieberstein, had her
<i>château</i> cut to ribbons. Her tapestry chairs were sliced
up with knives, her china and mirrors broken, her beautiful
chapel knocked to pieces, her bed ripped up and the
feathers scattered from garret to cellar. It was rather
queer to hear this tale from a German woman after Mme.
Huard's tale of the wreck of her <i>château</i> in northern
France by the Germans.</p>

<p>They told me, too, of a nurse, a friend of theirs, who
had gone to Russia. There she found, among other
things, a carload of children, eighty in number, all dead
of starvation. The Russians had put them in the car,
sidetracked it, and forgotten it. Some other cars were
found containing 200 people, all dead but one child in its
mother's arms. The nurse saw the Czarina and told her
of these, and many other things, and she said the Empress
burst into tears. Well she might!</p>

<p>The Germans are told that if the Russians get into East
Prussia again, they are to send the women away immediately&mdash;those
who stay are all outraged.</p>


<h3>VIII&mdash;A VISIT WITH ZIMMERMANN</h3>

<div class="right">
<i>June 12th.</i>
</div>

<p>Agatha Grabish called this morning. She has been to
East Prussia. One old woman she talked to said she had
stayed for the first Russian invasion.</p>

<p>"Why?" Agatha asked her.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "my bread was baking when the others
started to go, and I didn't want to leave it. But I might
just as well have," she added, "because the Russians came
in and ate it all up as soon as I took it out of the oven."</p>

<p>Billy (the author's husband) and I went to see Zimmermann
in the Foreign Office. He, with Von Bethmann-Hollweg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Von Jagow, Helfferich, and Falkenhayn,
are running Germany. Zimmermann is a large, blond
man. His forehead is exceptionally high and his cheeks
much scarred by sword slashes. He is genial, calm, and
although the busiest man in the Empire, quite unhurried.</p>

<p>"I have just been seeing some bankers," said he. "We
are negotiating another loan for our Turkish friends.
Those people are always in need of money."</p>

<p>Billy said it was a great imposition for us to take up
his time, as he was probably very busy. He laughed and
declared he was glad to see us. I told him he was like
Disraeli, who said he was not "unusually busy to-day"
but "usually busy."...</p>

<p>We asked him whether Germany looked for a long
peace after the war, and whether it would be on the
grounds of great military strength and strong boundaries,
or on the basis of an international conciliatory
body, or a treaty?</p>

<p>He answered that nothing short of a United States of
Europe would amount to anything, and seemed to possess
the usual German skepticism of treaties.</p>

<p>"We will have to have a United States of Europe
some day, to enable us to compete economically with
America. That may come in eighty or one hundred years,
but not in our lifetime. If you would really develop
your natural resources, we in Europe would be helpless...."</p>


<h3>IX&mdash;TEA WITH BARONESS VON BISSING</h3>

<div class="right">
<i>June 27th.</i>
</div>

<p>I went to Baroness von Bissing's to tea. Oh, welcome
was the hour and her comfortable chair! She is small,
with finely chiselled features; her movements are quick,
like those of a highly bred animal, and she is rather excitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>We sat down to tea and cherry tarts and I asked her
when she was next going to Belgium. She can, of course,
go whenever she likes, but is never there officially, as no
German officer may take his wife to Belgium. The General,
being so strict a gentleman, will not break the rule
even for himself, and so Baroness von Bissing and her
children must live alone in Germany, and he with his
150 aides-de-camp in his palace in Brussels.</p>

<p>"It is very hard to be without my husband and my
eldest son," she said.</p>

<p>"Where is your boy?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He was taken prisoner by the French, wounded in
six places. When he got well, they took him to prison
and put him in solitary confinement in a little tiny cell
with no work to do and no one with whom he can speak.
He may not even look out of the cell window, for they
painted it white. Twice a day he is taken for a walk
by his guards&mdash;and this all because the French thought
we did not treat Delcassé's son properly. Now, because
they took my boy, and another, we have put six of their
men in solitary confinement. We will see where these
reprisals will bring us; I am sorry they must be, but we
have more captured men than they."</p>

<p>"Why did they put Delcassé's son in prison in the first
place?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Because he was an impertinent boy and called his
officers 'dirty dogs of Prussians,'" she answered....</p>

<p>"Serbia and Montenegro are full of people that need
to be punished, but Italy&mdash;Italy!"&mdash;said Frau von Bissing,
with her pretty nose in the air&mdash;"is a nasty little dog
that has done something dirty and must be kicked
out!"...</p>

<p>"England is a disgusting hypocrite," said my hostess
emphatically. "France is not so bad; we do not hate
her, but England is in this war solely for money. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
a pleasant little joke of theirs, about our invading Belgium
first, but I <i>know</i> that the English and French were
there before us."</p>

<p>Now, if the wife of the Governor of Belgium believes
this so earnestly, one may imagine how firmly the rest
of Germany believes it....</p>


<h3>X&mdash;AT THE CLUB WITH BARON VON MUMM</h3>

<div class="right">
<i>July 1st.</i>
</div>

<p>Went to the Von Gwinners' to lunch. It was Von
Gwinner who put through the Bagdad Railway scheme.
The house is large, but there is a life-size marble statue
of a woman playing a violin in the drawing-room. He
has a beautiful garden.</p>

<p>Von Gwinner said the victor in this war would be
the nation which declared bankruptcy two weeks after
all the rest. He expects they will all be taxed to the
verge of poverty when the war is over, but believes Germany
can hold out the longest.</p>

<p>Dined with Baron von Mumm Tuesday night at the
Automobile Club. He is a fraud, and Count Montjelas
with him, and I hope to see them both soon to tell them
so. There was a crowd in the Leipziger Platz when I
got there, and the two men were standing at the window.
I asked what it was and they said: "Nothing, nothing,
only the usual people going home from work." Now,
whether they knew or not, I am not sure, but it really
was the Socialists publicly demonstrating their disapproval
of the imprisonment of Liebknecht for two years
and a half. That shows what a Berlin riot is. I looked
on and never knew it!</p>

<p>We've heard from Freiherr von B&mdash;&mdash; that there
was a really recognizable one in Düsseldorf. All the
women went to the City Hall and demanded more meat
and potatoes. The Mayor stuck his shaved head out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the window and tried to calm them with tales of beans
and peas, but they shouted they did not want them, they
wanted potatoes and, when he said he hadn't any, they
smashed all the windows that couldn't resist brick.</p>

<p>"That's just like the poor," said Von B&mdash;&mdash;, "they
won't eat anything except potatoes."</p>

<p>Baron Böcklin showed us pictures he'd taken on the
front. In one little house in Belgium, which he'd made
his headquarters, a woman sneaked in on him one night
when he was sleeping. He heard her and, jumping up,
caught her by the throat. She had a long knife in her
hand. As Böcklin was taking it from her, a man crawled
out from under his bed with a gun, but was covered by
the sergeant who came to Böcklin's rescue. The Baron
let both assassins go, instead of having them shot as he
had the right to do. Böcklin's mother was an American,
and his grandmother an Englishwoman....</p>

<p>Heard a delightful story about Mr. Gerard from Mrs.
&mdash;&mdash;. She said that to tease Countess B&mdash;&mdash; he
asked her why she hadn't married some nice stockbroker
in New York, who could have provided her with much
better-looking clothes, and more of them, than Count
B&mdash;&mdash;. She went home in a rage and told the Count,
who also became furious and they both told all Berlin
that Mr. Gerard was so anti-German that he disapproved
of German-American marriages. Mrs. Gerard implores
her husband to save his jokes for those who have a sense
of humor but he says, no matter what resolutions he
makes, Countess B&mdash;&mdash; is more than he can resist, and
his remarks grow always worse instead of better.</p>


<h3>XI&mdash;GUEST OF WARBURG, GERMAN BANKER</h3>

<div class="right">
<i>July 6th.</i>
</div>

<p>That night we went to the Max Warburgs' to dine.
They are very delightful people; their house is large and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
nice, their sense of humor a joy to find, and besides that,
Mrs. Warburg was well dressed and wore&mdash;oh, wonder
of wonders in a German woman&mdash;silk stockings. Mr.
Warburg is one of the biggest bankers of Germany, and
is certainly the nicest. He declared American business
men and American financiers to be the most charming
and the most uninformed men in the world.</p>

<p>"They know nothing of international affairs, not one
thing," said he. "And they do not even know their own
country thoroughly. We wonder over here how they can
possibly get along with such little knowledge of the affairs
of the world." He said he told his brother, Mr. Paul
Warburg, that it's easy enough for him to be a big man
in America, where there is so little competition, but just
let him come to Germany and try it. One may think
America is work-mad, but it seems a shiftless, lazy place
after Germany....</p>


<h3>XII&mdash;TALK WITH COUNT BLUCHER</h3>

<div class="right">
<i>July 13th.</i>
</div>

<p>Lunched at the Lays'. They had a party for Prince
Christian of Hesse and his wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Roger's
mother and father. The Blüchers were to have been
there, but old Count Blücher chose this morning to drop
dead off his horse. He must have been a charming old
man. Most of his life he spent trying to evade his German
taxes. He had an island off the coast of England,
on which he kept a great many kangaroos. Perhaps he
thought they added a touch of British atmosphere to his
estate. He wished to know if he couldn't come to America
and live there about a week, in order to become an
American citizen, as he found his island didn't get him
out of paying his German taxes, but when told it would
take even longer than a week to become an American
citizen, he gave up that idea. He was much interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
in America but said he thought it must be dangerous to
have so many buffaloes around. And, when he heard of
the lynchings our peace-loving citizens occasionally like
to indulge in, he suggested we let our wild Indians out
to subdue the lynchers. "That would soon put a stop to
such riots," said the old gentleman.</p>


<h3>XIII&mdash;AT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN BRUSSELS</h3>

<div class="right">
<i>July 31st.</i>
</div>

<p>Upon Billy's appealing to Count Harrach, we were
allowed to go to tea with the Whitlocks. Diplomatic
life in Belgium to-day is one of the experiences it is no
harm to omit. If the American Diplomats attempt to
be tactful with Belgians about the Germans, and say that
they really are a nice lot after all, Belgian doors close and
hats are not lifted in the street. Yet if they refused to
see Germans or avoided them they would shortly be requested
to leave on the grounds of being anti-German.
Tact and diplomacy have a hard life in Belgium now....</p>

<p>Philip Platt, who was also at lunch, had, as his chief
worry that day, the knowledge that the three young
Princesses de Ligne, who are ardently working for their
country, were feeding the children in the Petites Abeilles
so fast that they nearly choked them. The question which
bothered him sorely was, who to get to tell the three noble
ladies that their attentions would be more appreciated if
they were less violent.</p>


<h3>XIV&mdash;DINNER WITH GENERAL VON BISSING</h3>

<div class="right">
<i>Berlin, August 2d.</i>
</div>

<p>Our last night in Brussels we dined with General von
Bissing. The dinner, for some peculiar reason, was given
for us.</p>

<p>The hall was filled with officers. One very glorious-looking
person took me in charge and introduced each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
man to me. They clicked their booted heels together and
kissed my hand. This audience over, the Governor appeared.
He is seventy-two and looks sixty. His face is
stern yet not unkind....</p>

<p>I asked Von Bissing if he approved of suffrage, and
he said: "Never! It is something terrible for women."...</p>


<h3>XV&mdash;THE KAISER AND VON HINDENBURG</h3>

<div class="right">
<i>Berlin, Aug. 4th.</i>
</div>

<p>Hindenburg has been given charge of the eastern front,
proving that Austria must have been feeling rather dejected.
He was in command almost two weeks before
the news came out. It must be a great blow to the Austrian
pride.</p>

<p>I wonder if he will drive the Russians back a second
time. When Hindenburg won the battle of Tannenberg
and drove the Russians out of East Prussia, he was executing
in reality what he had lectured the military students
about for twenty years. In his lecture course he
had called it the "Battle of the Masurian Lakes," and
none in the world knew so well what to do in just the
situation which arose as did the retired general. He had
been refused, at the beginning of the war, as too old,
and was obliged to sit at home helpless, and read about
the Russians swarming into his country. At this point,
the Kaiser remembered Hindenburg. In the middle of
the night orders arrived that the General in command of
the eastern front had been deposed and Hindenburg put
in his place. A special train was waiting and Hindenburg
started at two in the morning and worked out his
plans as he sped towards the advancing Russian army.
In three days the enemy was in retreat and Germany was
saved. Is it a wonder the people call him: <i>Unser Hindenburg</i>?
The story goes that the General who was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
command sent word to the Kaiser that he must retreat
behind the Oder. The Kaiser sent word back: "Retire
behind the Oder, but without the army," and immediately
sent for old Hindenburg. The General never plays politics.
A few years ago, when there was a general inspection
of troops, they conducted a sham battle. General
Von Moltke managed to get a very strong position;
then the Kaiser, as a grand finale, led an immense cavalry
charge down a plain and exposed his troops to fire from
three sides. As a grandstand play, it was magnificent.
Triumphant, the Kaiser rode up to General Hindenburg,
the referee.</p>

<p>"How was that, General?" he demanded, proudly.</p>

<p>The General saluted.</p>

<p>"All dead but one, Sir," he said.</p>


<h3>XVI&mdash;TEA WITH COUNTESS BERNSTORFF</h3>

<div class="right">
<i>August 13th.</i>
</div>

<p>Had tea with Constance Minot and Countess Bernstorff
the other day. Just now she is in a great state of
nerves over the thought of going to America to join the
Ambassador. She declared she knew the English had
been lying in wait for her for two years and were going
to be as disagreeable as possible.</p>

<p>"They will search everything I have, I know," said
she. "They will wash my back with acid and they will
rip the lining out of everything, and I shall never be fit
to be seen again."</p>

<p>In vain Constance and I assured her that she would
be treated with great respect. I told her we had had
no trouble at all, and she said: "What did you do?" I
answered that we made love to the English inspection officer
and asked him to dinner, and asked her why she
shouldn't do the same.</p>

<p>"I suppose that would be the best way," she answered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Another real grievance was that everyone had tried to
give her things to bring to friends and relatives in America.</p>

<p>"One woman gave me a large box. I opened it and
found a toy Zeppelin. Imagine if the English had found
that in my trunk! They would have taken me off the
boat and hanged me, surely!" she said, with a laugh.</p>


<h3>XVII&mdash;A WALK WITH AMBASSADOR GERARD</h3>

<div class="right">
<i>August 15th.</i>
</div>

<p>Went to Herringsdorf on the one o'clock train Saturday
with Lithgow Osborne and Christian Herter. The
Ambassador was in Herringsdorf with Aileen and Lanier
Winslow....</p>

<p>After dinner we went for a walk on the pier. I was
with the Ambassador, who kept making his dry, humorous
remarks about everyone. Soon a guard turned us back.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You are in Germany," replied Mr. Gerard. "Don't
forget that. They wait until they find out that people
like to do a thing, and then at once they forbid it."</p>

<p>"What I'd like best, Mr. Gerard," said I, "would be to
hear you talk to the powers that be in Germany. It must
be rather difficult for them to understand all your jokes."</p>

<p>"It is," he replied. "They can't make me out at all
here."</p>

<p>He makes the most glorious remarks to every one. I
heard that, apropos of the <i>Lusitania</i>, the Ambassador said
to the Chancellor:</p>

<p>"Your argument about the <i>Lusitania</i> amounts to just
this. If I were to write a note to your sister and say:
'If you go out on the Wilhelm Platz, I will shoot you!'
and if she did go out on the Wilhelm Platz and I shot
her&mdash;that would be her fault, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>And one day when Zimmerman remarked: "The United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
States couldn't go to war with us, because we have 500,000
trained Germans in the United States," the Ambassador
replied: "You may have 500,000 trained Germans
in the United States, but don't forget that we have 500,001
lamp-posts."</p>

I&mdash;STORY OF "KITCHENER'S ARMY"</h3>

<p>"The New Army," "Kitchener's Army," we go by
many names. The older sergeants&mdash;men who have
served in regular battalions&mdash;sometimes call us "Kitchener's
Mob," and swear that to take us to war would be
another "Massacre of the Innocents." At other times
they affirm that we are a credit to our instructors (themselves);
but such affirmations have become rarer since
beer went up to threepence a pint.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>
<p>We are a mixed lot&mdash;a triumph of democracy, like the
Tubes. Some of us have fifty years to our credit and
only own to thirty; others are sixteen and claim to be
eighteen. Some of us enlisted for glory, and some for
fun, and a few for fear of starvation. Some of us
began by being stout, and have lost weight; others were
seedy and are filling out. Some of us grumble, and go
sick to escape parades; but for the most part we are
aggressively cheerful, and were never fitter in our lives.
Some miss their glass of claret, others their fish-and-chips;
but as we all sleep on the floor, and have only
one suit, which is rapidly becoming very disreputable,
you would never tell t'other from which.</p>

<p>We sing as we march. Such songs we sing! All
about coons and girls, parodies of hymns, parodies about
Kaiser Bill, and sheer unadulterated nonsense. We shall
sing</p>

<div class="poem">
"Where's yer girl?<br />
Ain't yer got none?"<br />
</div>

<p>as we march into battle.</p>

<p>Battle! Battle, murder, and sudden death! Maiming,
slaughter, blood, extremities of fear and discomfort and
pain! How incredibly remote all that seems! We don't
believe in it really. It is just a great game we are learning.
It is part of the game to make little short rushes in
extended order, to lie on our bellies and keep our heads
down, snap our rifles and fix our bayonets. Just a game,
that's all, and then home to tea.</p>

<p>Some of us think that these young officers take the
game a jolly sight too seriously. Twice this week we
have been late for dinner, and once they routed us out
to play it at night. That was a bit too thick! The
canteen was shut when we got back and we missed our
pint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Anyhow we are Kitchener's Army, and we are quite
sure it will be all right. Just send us to Flanders, and
see if it ain't. We're Kitchener's Army, and we don't
care if it snows ink!</p>


<h3>II&mdash;STORY OF THE BELOVED CAPTAIN</h3>

<p>He came in the early days, when we were still at
recruit drills under the hot September sun. Tall, erect,
smiling: so we first saw him, and so he remained to the
end. At the start he knew as little of soldiering as we
did. He used to watch us being drilled by the sergeant;
but his manner of watching was peculiarly his own. He
never looked bored. He was learning just as much as
we were, in fact more. He was learning his job, and
from the first he saw that his job was more than to give
the correct orders. His job was to lead us. So he
watched, and noted many things, and never found the
time hang heavy on his hands. He watched our evolutions,
so as to learn the correct orders; he watched for
the right manner of command, the manner which secured
the most prompt response to an order; and he watched
every one of us for our individual characteristics. We
were his men. Already he took an almost paternal interest
in us. He noted the men who tried hard, but were
naturally slow and awkward. He distinguished them
from those who were inattentive and bored. He marked
down the keen and efficient amongst us. Most of all he
studied those who were subject to moods, who were
sulky one day and willing the next. These were the
ones who were to turn the scale. If only he could get
these on his side, the battle would be won.</p>

<p>For a few days he just watched. Then he started
work. He picked out some of the most awkward ones,
and, accompanied by a corporal, marched them away by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
themselves. Ingenuously he explained that he did not
know much himself yet; but he thought that they might
get on better if they drilled by themselves a bit, and that
if he helped them, and they helped him, they would soon
learn. His confidence was infectious. He looked at
them, and they looked at him, and the men pulled themselves
together and determined to do their best. Their
best surprised themselves. His patience was inexhaustible.
His simplicity could not fail to be understood.
His keenness and optimism carried all with them. Very
soon the awkward squad found themselves awkward no
longer; and soon after that they ceased to be a squad,
and went back to the platoon.</p>

<p>Then he started to drill the platoon, with the sergeant
standing by to point out his mistakes. Of course he
made mistakes, and when that happened he never minded
admitting it. He would explain what mistakes he had
made, and try again. The result was that we began to
take almost as much interest and pride in his progress
as he did in ours. We were his men, and he was our
leader. We felt that he was a credit to us, and we resolved
to be a credit to him. There was a bond of
mutual confidence and affection between us, which grew
stronger and stronger as the months passed. He had a
smile for almost everyone; but we thought that he had a
different smile for us. We looked for it, and were
never disappointed. On parade, as long as we were trying,
his smile encouraged us. Off parade, if we passed
him and saluted, his eyes looked straight into our own,
and his smile greeted us. It was a wonderful thing,
that smile of his. It was something worth living for,
and worth working for. It bucked one up when one
was bored or tired. It seemed to make one look at things
from a different point of view, a finer point of view, his
point of view. There was nothing feeble or weak about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
it. It was not monotonous like the smile of "Sunny
Jim." It meant something. It meant that we were his
men, and that he was proud of us, and sure that we were
going to do jolly well&mdash;better than any of the other
platoons. And it made us determine that we would.
When we failed him, when he was disappointed in us, he
did not smile. He did not rage or curse. He just looked
disappointed, and that made us feel far more savage
with ourselves than any amount of swearing would have
done. He made us feel that we were not playing the
game by him. It was not what he said. He was never
very good at talking. It was just how he looked. And
his look of displeasure and disappointment was a thing
that we would do anything to avoid. The fact was that
he had won his way into our affections. We loved him.
And there isn't anything stronger than love, when all's
said and done.</p>


<h3>III&mdash;"A TOUCH OF CHRIST ABOUT HIM"</h3>

<p>He was good to look on. He was big and tall, and
held himself upright. His eyes looked his own height.
He moved with the grace of an athlete. His skin was
tanned by a wholesome outdoor life, and his eyes were
clear and wide open. Physically he was a prince among
men. We used to notice, as we marched along the road
and passed other officers, that they always looked pleased
to see him. They greeted him with a cordiality which
was reserved for him. Even the general seemed to have
singled him out, and cast an eye of special approval upon
him. Somehow, gentle though he was, he was never
familiar. He had a kind of innate nobility which marked
him out as above us. He was not democratic. He was
rather the justification for aristocracy. We all knew instinctively
that he was our superior&mdash;a man of finer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
temper than ourselves, a "toff" in his own right. I
suppose that that was why he could be so humble without
loss of dignity. For he was humble too, if that is the
right word, and I think it is. No trouble of ours was
too small for him to attend to. When we started route
marches, for instance, and our feet were blistered and
sore, as they often were at first, you would have thought
that they were his own feet from the trouble he took.
Of course after the march there was always an inspection
of feet. That is the routine. But with him it was
no mere routine. He came into our rooms, and if anyone
had a sore foot he would kneel down on the floor
and look at it as carefully as if he had been a doctor.
Then he would prescribe, and the remedies were ready at
hand, being borne by the sergeant. If a blister had to be
lanced he would very likely lance it himself there and
then, so as to make sure that it was done with a clean
needle and that no dirt was allowed to get in. There
was no affectation about this, no striving after effect.
It was simply that he felt that our feet were pretty important,
and that he knew that we were pretty careless.
So he thought it best at the start to see to the matter
himself. Nevertheless, there was in our eyes something
almost religious about this care for our feet. It seemed
to have a touch of the Christ about it, and we loved and
honored him the more.</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;"A TORPEDO FELL&mdash;THAT WAS THE END"</h3>

<p>We knew that we should lose him. For one thing,
we knew that he would be promoted. It was our great
hope that some day he would command the company.
Also we knew that he would be killed. He was so amazingly
unself-conscious. For that reason we knew that
he would be absolutely fearless. He would be so keen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
on the job in hand, and so anxious for his men, that he
would forget about his own danger. So it proved. He
was a captain when we went out to the front. Whenever
there was a tiresome job to be done, he was there
in charge. If ever there were a moment of danger, he
was on the spot. If there were any particular part of
the line where the shells were falling faster or the bombs
dropping more thickly than in other parts, he was in it.
It was not that he was conceited and imagined himself
indispensable. It was just that he was so keen that the
men should do their best, and act worthily of the regiment.
He knew that fellows hated turning out at night
for fatigue, when they were in a "rest camp." He knew
how tiresome the long march there and back and the
digging in the dark for an unknown purpose were. He
knew that fellows would be inclined to grouse and shirk,
so he thought that it was up to him to go and show
them that he thought it was a job worth doing. And
the fact that he was there put a new complexion on the
matter altogether. No one would shirk if he were there.
No one would grumble so much, either. What was good
enough for him was good enough for us. If it were not
too much trouble for him to turn out, it was not too
much trouble for us. He knew, too, how trying to the
nerves it is to sit in a trench and be shelled. He knew
what a temptation there is to move a bit farther down
the trench and herd together in a bunch at what seems
the safest end. He knew, too, the folly of it, and that
it was not the thing to do&mdash;not done in the best regiments.
So he went along to see that it did not happen,
to see that the men stuck to their posts, and conquered
their nerves. And as soon as we saw him, we forgot our
own anxiety. It was: "Move a bit farther down, sir.
We are all right here; but don't you go exposing of
yourself." We didn't matter. We knew it then. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
were just the rank and file, bound to take risks. The
company would get along all right without us. But the
captain, how was the company to get on without him?
To see him was to catch his point of view, to forget our
personal anxieties, and only to think of the company, and
the regiment, and honor.</p>

<p>There was not one of us but would gladly have died
for him. We longed for the chance to show him that.
We weren't heroes. We never dreamed about the V. C.
But to save the captain we would have earned it ten
times over, and never have cared a button whether we
got it or not. We never got the chance, worse luck. It
was all the other way. We were holding some trenches
which were about as unhealthy as trenches could be. The
Boches were only a few yards away, and were well
supplied with trench mortars. We hadn't got any at
that time. Bombs and air torpedoes were dropping round
us all day. Of course the captain was there. It seemed
as if he could not keep away. A torpedo fell into the
trench, and buried some of our chaps. The fellows
next to them ran to dig them out. Of course he was one
of the first. Then came another torpedo in the same
place. That was the end.</p>

<p>But he lives. Somehow he lives. And we who knew
him do not forget. We feel his eyes on us. We still
work for that wonderful smile of his. There are not
many of the old lot left now; but I think that those
who went West have seen him. When they got to the
other side I think they were met. Someone said: "Well
done, good and faithful servant." And as they knelt
before that gracious pierced Figure, I reckon they saw
nearby the captain's smile. Anyway, in that faith let me
die, if death should come my way; and so, I think, shall
I die content.</p>

<h2>"THE RED HORIZON"&mdash;STORIES OF
THE LONDON IRISH</h2>

<div class="center"><i>The Man With the Rosary</i><br /><br />
<i>Told by Patrick MacGill, Rifleman Number 3008,
London Irish</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>Patrick MacGill is the genius of the battlefield. The War has
given his great Irish heart its opportunity to express itself, and
his stories from the front have become little classics in the
War's literature. He dedicates his stories: "To the London
Irish, to the Spirit of Those Who Fight and to the Memory of
Those Who Have Passed Away." A letter to him by the
President of the County of London Territorial Association
reads: "When I recruited you into the London Irish&mdash;one of
those splendid regiments that London has sent to Sir John
French, himself an Irishman&mdash;it was with gratitude and pride.
You had much to give us. The rare experiences of your boyhood,
your talents, your brilliant hopes for the future. Upon
all these the Western hills and loughs of your native Donegal
seemed to have the prior claim. But you gave them to London
and to our London Territorials. The London Irish will be
proud of their young artist in words and he will forever be
proud of the London Irish Regiment, its deeds and valour, to
which he has dedicated such great gifts. May God preserve
you." Patrick MacGill, shoulder to shoulder with the Tommies
as a private soldier, is writing many great books. The following
stories are taken from his volume entitled "The Red Horizon,"

I&mdash;THE SOLDIER TELLS HIS TALE</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>
<p>Sometimes when our spell in the trenches comes to
an end we go back for a rest in some village or town.
Here the <i>estaminet</i> or <i>debitant</i> (French, as far as I am
aware, for a beer shop), is open to the British soldier
for three hours daily, from twelve to one and from six
to eight o'clock. For some strange reason we often find
ourselves busy on parade at these hours, and when not
on parade we generally find ourselves without money. I
have been here for four months; looking at my pay book
I find that I've been paid 25 fr. (or in plain English, one
pound) since I have come to France, a country where
the weather grows hotter daily, where the water is seldom
drinkable, and where wine and beer is so cheap. Once we
were paid five francs at five o'clock in the afternoon after
five penniless days of rest in a village, and ordered as we
were paid, to pack up our all and get ready to set off at
six o'clock for the trenches. From noon we had been
playing cards, and some of the boys gambled all their
pay in advance and lost it. Bill's five francs had to be
distributed amongst several members of the platoon.</p>

<p>"It's only five francs, anyway," he said. "Wot matter
whether I spend it on cards, wine, or women? I
don't care for soldierin' as a profession."</p>

<p>"What is your profession, Bill?" Pryor asked; we
never really knew what Bill's civil occupation was, he
seemed to know a little of many crafts, but was master
of none.</p>

<p>"I've been everything," he replied, employing his little
finger in the removal of cigarette ash. "My ole man
apprenticed me to a marker of 'ot cross buns, but I
'ad a 'abit of makin' the long end of the cross on the
short side, an' got chucked out. Then I learned 'ow to
jump through tin plates in order to make them nutmeg
graters, but left that job after sticking plump in the
middle of a plate. I had to stop there for three days
without food or drink. They were thinnin' me out, see!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Then I was a draughts manager at a bank, and shut the
ventilators; after that I was an electric mechanic; I
switched the lights on and off at night and mornin';
now I'm a professional gambler, I lose all my tin."</p>

<p>"You're also a soldier," I said.</p>

<p>"Course, I am," Bill replied. "I can present hipes by
numbers, and knock the guts out of sandbags at five
hundred yards."</p>


<h3>II&mdash;A NIGHT MARCH IN THE RAIN</h3>

<p>We did not leave the village until eight o'clock. It
was now very dark and had begun to rain, not real rain,
but a thin drizzle which mixed up with the flashes of
guns, the glow of star-shells, the long tremulous glimmer
of flashlights, the blood red blaze of haystacks afire near
Givenchy, threw a sombre haze over our line of march.
Even through the haze, star-shells showed brilliant in
their many different colours, red, green, and electric
white. The French send up a beautiful light which
bursts into four different flames that burn standing high
in mid-air for five minutes; another, a parachute star,
holds the sky for three minutes, and almost blots its more
remote sisters from the heavens. The English and the
Germans are content to fling rockets across and observe
one another's lines while these flare out their brief meteoric
life. The firing-line was about five miles away;
the star-lights seemed to rise and fall just beyond an
adjacent spinney, so deceptive are they.</p>

<p>Part of our journey ran along the bank of a canal;
there had been some heavy fighting the night previous,
and the wounded were still coming down by barges, only
those who are badly hurt come this way, the less serious
cases go by motor ambulance from dressing station to
hospital&mdash;those who are damaged slightly in arm or head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
generally walk. Here we encountered a party of men
marching in single file with rifles, skeleton equipment,
picks and shovels. In the dark it was impossible to distinguish
the regimental badge.</p>

<p>"Oo are yer?" asked Bill, who, like a good many more
of us, was smoking a cigarette contrary to orders.</p>

<p>"The Camberwell Gurkhas," came the answer. "Oo
are yer?"</p>

<p>"The Chelesa Cherubs," said Bill. "Up workin'?"</p>

<p>"Doin' a bit between the lines," answered one of the
working party. "Got bombed out and were sent back."</p>

<p>"Lucky dogs, goin' back for a kip (sleep)."</p>

<p>"'Ad two killed and seven wounded."</p>

<p>"Blimey!"</p>

<p>"Good luck, boys," said the disappearing file as the
darkness swallowed up the working party.</p>

<p>The pace was a sharp one. Half a mile back from
the firing-line we turned off to the left and took our way
by a road running parallel to the trenches. We had put
on our waterproof capes, our khaki overcoats had been
given up a week before.</p>

<p>The rain dripped down our clothes, our faces and our
necks, each successive star-light showed the water trickling
down our rifle butts and dripping to the roadway.
Stoner slept as he marched, his hand in Kore's. We
often move along in this way, it is quite easy, there is
lullaby in the monotonous step, and the slumbrous crunching
of nailed boots on gravel.</p>

<p>We turned off the road where it runs through the
rubble and scattered bricks, all that remains of the village
of Givenchy, and took our way across a wide field. The
field was under water in the wet season, and a brick
pathway had been built across it. Along this path we
took our way. A strong breeze had risen and was swishing
our waterproofs about our bodies; the darkness was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
intense, I had to strain my eyes to see the man in front,
Stoner. In the darkness he was a nebulous dark bulk
that sprang into bold relief when the star-lights flared
in front. When the flare died out we stumbled forward
into pitch dark nothingness. The pathway was barely
two feet across, a mere tight-rope in the wide waste,
and on either side nothing stood out to give relief to the
desolate scene; over us the clouds hung low, shapeless
and gloomy, behind was the darkness, in front when the
star-lights made the darkness visible they only increased
the sense of solitude.</p>

<p>We stumbled and fell, rose and fell again, our capes
spreading out like wings and our rifles falling in the mud.
The sight of a man or woman falling always makes me
laugh. I laughed as I fell, as Stoner fell, as Mervin,
Goliath, Bill, or Pryor fell. Sometimes we fell singly,
again in pairs, often we fell together a heap of rifles,
khaki, and waterproof capes. We rose grumbling, spitting
mud and laughing. Stoner was very unfortunate, a
particle of dirt got into his eye, almost blinding him.
Afterwards he crawled along, now and again getting to
his feet, merely to fall back into his earthy position.
A rifle fire opened on us from the front, and bullets
whizzed past our ears, voices mingled with the ting of
searching bullets.</p>

<p>"Anybody hurt?"</p>

<p>"No, all right so far."</p>

<p>"Stoner's down."</p>

<p>"He's up again."</p>

<p>"Blimey, it's a balmy."</p>

<p>"Mervin's crawling on his hands and knees."</p>

<p>"Nark the doin's,' ye're on my water proof. Let go!"</p>

<p>"Goliath's down."</p>

<p>"Are you struck, Goliath?"</p>

<p>"No, I wish to heaven I was," muttered the giant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
bulking up in the flare of a searchlight, blood dripping
from his face showed where he had been scratched as he
stumbled.</p>

<p>We got safely into the trench and relieved the Highland
Light Infantry. The place was very quiet, they
assured us, it is always the same. It has become trench
etiquette to tell the relieving battalion that it is taking
over a cushy position. By this trench next morning we
found six newly made graves, telling how six Highlanders
had met their death, killed in action.</p>


<h3>III&mdash;"THE DEAD MAN UNDER MY FEET"</h3>

<p>Next morning as I was looking through a periscope at
the enemy's trenches, and wondering what was happening
behind their sandbag line, a man from the sanitary
squad came along sprinkling the trench with creosote and
chloride of lime.</p>

<p>"Seein' anything?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not much," I answered, "the grass is so high in
front that I can see nothing but the tips of the enemy's
parapets. There's some work for you here," I said.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Under your feet," I told him. "The floor is soft as
putty and smells vilely. Perhaps there is a dead man
there. Last night I slept by the spot and it turned me
sick."</p>

<p>"Have you an entrenchin' tool?"</p>

<p>I handed him the implement, he dug into the ground
and presently unearthed a particle of clothing, five minutes
later a boot came to view, then a second; fifteen
minutes assiduous labour revealed an evil-smelling bundle
of clothing and decayed flesh. I still remained an onlooker,
but changed my position on the banquette.</p>

<p>"He must have been dead a long time," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
sanitary man, as he flung handfuls of lime on the body,
"see his face."</p>

<p>He turned the thing on its back, its face up to the
sky. The features were wonderfully well-preserved; the
man might have fallen the day before. The nose pinched
and thin, turned up a little at the point, the lips were
drawn tight round the gums, the teeth showed dog-like
and vicious; the eyes were open and raised towards the
forehead, and the whole face was splashed with clotted
blood. A wound could be seen on the left temple, the
fatal bullet had gone through there.</p>

<p>"He was killed in the winter," said the sanitary man,
pointing at the gloves on the dead soldier's hand. "These
trenches were the 'Allemands'' then, and the boys
charged 'em. I suppose this feller copped a packet and
dropped into the mud and was tramped down."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" I asked.</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;A CRUCIFIX AND A LOVE LETTER</h3>

<p>The man with the chloride of lime opened the tunic and
shirt of the dead man and brought out an identity disc.</p>

<p>"Irish," he said, "Munster Fusiliers. What's this?"
he asked, taking a string of beads with a little shiny
crucifix on the end of it, from the dead man's neck.</p>

<p>"It's his rosary," I said, and my mind saw in a vivid
picture a barefooted boy going over the hills of Corrymeela
to morning Mass, with his beads in his hand. On
either side rose the thatched cabins of the peasantry, the
peat smoke curling from the chimneys, the little boreens
running through the bushes, the brown Irish bogs, the
heather in blossom, the turf stacks, the laughing
colleens....</p>

<p>"Here's a letter," said the sanitary man; "it was posted
last Christmas. It's from a girl, too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>He commenced reading:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear Patrick,&mdash;I got your letter yesterday, and
whenever I was my lone the day I was always reading
it. I wish the black war was over and you back again&mdash;we
all at home wish that, and I suppose yourself wishes
it as well; I was up at your house last night; there's not
much fun in it now. I read the papers to your mother,
and me and her was looking at a map. But we didn't
know where you were so we could only make guesses.
Your mother and me is making the Rounds of the Cross
for you, and I am always thinking of you in my prayers.
You'll be having the parcel I sent before you get this
letter. I hope it's not broken or lost. The socks I sent
were knitted by myself, three pairs of them, and I've put
the holy water on them. Don't forget to put them on
when your feet get wet, at home you never used to bother
about anything like that; just tear about the same in wet
as dry. But you'll take care of yourself now, won't you:
and not get killed? It'll be a grand day when you come
back, and God send the day to come soon! Send a letter
as often as you can; I myself will write you one every
day, and I'll pray to the Holy Mother to take care of
you."</p>

<p>We buried him behind the parados, and placed the
rosary round the arms of the cross which was erected
over him. On the following day one of our men went
out to see the grave, and while stooping to place some
flowers on it he got shot through the head. That evening
he was buried beside the Munster Fusilier.</p>

<p>(Patrick MacGill tells many heart stories of the
trenches in "The Red Horizon." He tells of "The Night
Before the Trenches"; "A Dugout Banquet"; "A Nocturnal
Adventure"; "Everyday Life at the Front"; "The
Women of France"&mdash;his genius is immortalizing every
human phase of the War.)</p>

<h2>MY TRIP TO VERDUN&mdash;GENERAL
PETAIN FACE TO FACE</h2>

<div class="center"><i>From Graves of the Marne to Hills of the Meuse</i><br /><br />
<i>Told by Frank H. Simonds, Famous American War
Historian</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Simonds is the first great historian that this war produced.
He traveled over the battlefields to record for history the
world-revolutionizing events as they were taking place. As the
intimate friend of Governments, General Staffs and diplomats,
he gathered his knowledge first hand and became recognized
throughout America and Europe as <i>the</i> historical authority on
the war's strategy. His judgments were weighed by such men
as President Poincaré and Lloyd-George&mdash;and followed with
interest by the officers of the armies. Mr. Simonds had been
studying military strategy for many years before the war; he
was an authority on the Napoleonic campaigns&mdash;but it was not
until the Great War that the "man and the opportunity met."
He was then an editorial writer on the <i>New York Sun</i>, where
his first prophetic editorials gained him immediate recognition.
He later became associate editor of the <i>New York Tribune</i>. His
reviews of the war began to appear in the <i>American Review of
Reviews</i>, for whom he produced his great five-volume "<i>History
of the World War</i>"&mdash;a work for the generations. We can tell
here but one of his brilliant stories&mdash;his "Visit to Verdun."</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>I&mdash;"I START FOR VERDUN&mdash;WITH THE
PRESIDENT'S PERMIT"</h3>

<p>My road to Verdun ran through the Elysée Palace, and
it was to the courtesy and interest of the President of
the French Republic that I owed my opportunity to see
the battle for the Meuse city at close range. Already
through the kindness of the French General Staff I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
seen the Lorraine and Marne battlegrounds and had been
guided over these fields by officers who had shared in
the opening battles that saved France. But Verdun was
more difficult; there is little time for caring for the wandering
correspondent when a decisive contest is going
forward, and quite naturally the General Staff turned a
deaf ear to my request.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of one of the many Frenchmen
who gave time and effort to make my pilgrimage a
success I was at last able to see M. Poincaré. Like our
own American President, the French Chief Magistrate is
never interviewed, and I mention this audience simply
because it was one more and in a sense the final proof
for me of the friendliness, the courtesy, the interest that
the American will find to-day in France. I had gone to
Paris, my ears filled with the warnings of those who told
me that it was hard to be an American in Europe, in
France, in the present hour. I had gone expecting, or at
least fearing, that I should find it so.</p>

<p>Instead, from peasant to President I found only kindness,
only gratitude, only a profound appreciation for
all that Americans had individually done for France in
the hour of her great trial. These things and one thing
more I found: a very intense desire that Americans
should be able to see for themselves; the Frenchmen will
not talk to you of what France has done, is doing; he
shrinks from anything that might suggest the imitation
of the German method of propaganda. In so far as it is
humanly possible he would have you see the thing for
yourself and testify out of your own mouth.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that all my difficulties vanished
when I had been permitted to express to the President
my desire to see Verdun and to go back to America&mdash;I
was sailing within the week&mdash;able to report what I had
seen with my own eyes of the decisive battle still going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
forward around the Lorraine city. Without further delay,
discussion, it was promised that I should go to Verdun
by motor, that I should go cared for by the French
military authorities and that I should be permitted to see
all that one could see at the moment of the contest.</p>

<p>We left Paris in the early afternoon; my companions
were M. Henri Ponsot, chief of the Press Service of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and M. Hugues le
Roux, a distinguished Frenchman of letters well known
to many Americans. To start for the battlefield from
a busy, peaceful city, to run for miles through suburbs
as quiet and lacking in martial aspect as the regions beyond
the Harlem, at home, was a thing that seemed almost
unreal; but only for a brief moment, for war has
come very near to Paris, and one may not travel far in
Eastern France without seeing its signs.</p>

<p>In less than an hour we were passing the rear of the
line held by the British at the Battle of the Marne, and
barely sixty minutes after we had passed out through
the Vincennes gate we met at Courtacon the first of the
ruined villages that for two hundred miles line the roadways
that lead from the capital to Lorraine and Champagne.
Suddenly in the midst of a peaceful countryside,
after passing a score of undisturbed villages, villages so
like one another, you come to one upon which the storm
has burst, and instead of snug houses, smiling faces, the
air of contentment and happiness that was France, there
is only a heap of ruins, houses with their roofs gone,
their walls torn by shell fire, villages abandoned partially
or wholly, contemporary Pompeiis, overtaken by the Vesuvius
of Krupp.</p>


<h3>II&mdash;THE GRAVES BY THE ROADSIDE</h3>

<p>Coincidentally there appear along the roadside, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
fields, among the plough furrows, on every side, the
crosses that mark the graves of those who died for
France&mdash;or for Germany. Along the slope you may mark
the passage of a charge by these crosses; those who fell
were buried as they lay, French and Germans with equal
care. Indeed, there is a certain pride visible in all that
the French do for their dead foes. Alongside a hamlet
wantonly burned, burned by careful labor and with
German thoroughness; in villages where you will be told
of nameless atrocities and shameful killings, you will
see the German graves, marked by neat crosses, surrounded
by sod embankments, marked with plaques of
black and white; the French are marked by plaques of
red, white and blue, and the latter invariably decorated
with a flag and flowers.</p>

<p>Once you have seen these graves by the roadside going
east you will hardly go a mile in two hundred which has
not its graves. From the environs of Meaux, a scant
twenty miles from Paris, to the frontier at the Seille, beyond
Nancy, there are graves and more graves, now scattered,
now crowded together where men fought hand to
hand. Passing them in a swift-moving auto, they seem
to march by you; there is the illusion of an arrow advancing
on the hillside, until at last, beyond Nancy, where
the fighting was so terrible, about little villages such as
Corbessaux, you come to the great common graves, where
a hundred or two hundred men have been gathered, where
the trenches now levelled are but long graves, and you
read, "Here rest 179 French soldiers," or across the road,
"Here 196 Germans."</p>

<p>Take a map of France and from a point just south of
Paris draw a straight line to the Vosges; twenty or thirty
miles to the north draw another. Between the two is the
black district of the Marne and Nancy battles. It is the
district of ruined villages, destroyed farms; it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
region where every hillside&mdash;so it will seem to the traveler&mdash;is
marked by these pathetic crosses. It is a region
in which the sense of death and destruction is abroad.
Go forty miles north again and draw two more lines, and
this is the region not of the death and destruction of
yesterday, but of to-day; this is the front, where the
graves are still in the making, the region of the Oise to
the Meuse, from Noyon to Verdun.</p>

<p>On this day our route led eastward through the villages
which in September, 1914, woke from at least a
century of oblivion, from the forgetting that followed
Napoleon's last campaign in France to a splendid but
terrible ten days: Courtacon, Sézanne, La-Fère Champenoise,
Vitry-le-François, the region where Franchet d'Esperey
and Foch fought, where the "Miracle of the Marne"
was performed. Mile after mile the countryside files
by, the never changing impression of a huge cemetery, the
hugest in the world, the stricken villages, now and then
striving to begin again, a red roof here and there telling
of the first counter offensive of peace, of construction
made against the whirlwind that had come and gone.</p>


<h3>III&mdash;"NOTHING BUT OLD MEN AND WOMEN&mdash;AND
CHILDREN"</h3>

<p>Always, too, nothing but old men and women, these and
children, working in the broad fields, still partially cultivated,
but no longer the fields of that perfectly cared
for France of the other peace days. Women and children
at the plough, old men bent double by age still spending
such strength as is left in the tasks that war has set for
them. This is the France behind the front, and, aside
from the ruined villages and graves, the France that
stretches from the Pyrenees to the Marne, a France from
which youth and manhood are gone, in which age and
childhood remain with the women. Yet in this land we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
were passing how much of the youth and manhood of
France and Germany was buried in the graves the crosses
demonstrated at every kilometer.</p>

<p>But a hundred miles east of Paris there begins a new
world. The graves, the shell-cursed villages, remain, but
this is no longer the France of the Marne fighting and
of the war of two years ago. At Vitry-le-François you
pass almost without warning into the region which is the
back of the front of to-day, the base of all the line of
fire from Rheims to the Meuse, and suddenly along the
road appear the canvas guideposts which bear the terse
warning, "Verdun." You pass suddenly from ancient to
contemporary history, from the killing of other years to
the killing that is of to-day&mdash;the killing and the wounding&mdash;and
along the hills where there are still graves there
begin to appear Red Cross tents and signs, and ambulances
pass you bearing the latest harvest.</p>

<p>And now every village is a garrison town. For a
hundred miles there have been only women and old men,
but now there are only soldiers; they fill the streets; they
crowd the doorways of the houses. The fields are filled
with tents, with horses, with all the impedimenta of an
army. The whole countryside is a place of arms. Every
branch of French service is about you&mdash;Tunisians, Turcos,
cavalry, the black, the brown and the white&mdash;the
men who yesterday or last week were in the first line,
who rest and will return to-morrow or next day to fight
again.</p>

<p>Unmistakably, too, you feel that this is the business
of war; you are in a factory, a machine shop; if the product
is death and destruction, it is no less a matter of
machinery, not of romance, of glamour. The back of the
front is a place of work and of rest for more work, but
of parade, of the brilliant, of the fascinating there is just
nothing. Men with bright but plainly weary faces, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
young men, but men of thirty and above, hard bitten by
their experience, patently fit, fed, but somehow related
to the ruins and the destruction around them, they are
all about you, and wherever now you see a grave you
will discover a knot of men standing before it talking
soberly. Wherever you see the vestiges of an old trench,
a hill that was fought for at this time twenty months ago,
you will see new practice trenches and probably the recruits
... the boys that are waiting for the call, listening
to an officer explaining to them what has been done
here, the mistake or the good judgment revealed by the
event. For France is training the youth that remains to
her on the still recent battlefields and in the presence of
those who died to keep the ground.</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;"WE JOIN THE VAST PROCESSION OF
DEATH"</h3>

<p>Just as the darkness came we passed St. Dizier and entered
at last upon the road to Verdun, the one road that
is the life line of the city. For to understand the real
problem of the defence of Verdun you must realize that
there is lacking to the city any railroad. In September,
1914, the Germans took St. Mihiel and cut the railway
coming north along the Meuse. On their retreat from
the Marne the soldiers of the Crown Prince halted at
Montfaucon and Varennes, and their cannon have commanded
the Paris-Verdun-Metz railroad ever since. Save
for a crazy narrow-gauge line wandering along the hill
slopes, climbing by impossible grades, Verdun is without
rail communication.</p>

<p>It was this that made the defence of the town next
to impossible. Partially to remedy the defect the French
had reconstructed a local highway running from St. Dizier
by Bar-le-Duc to Verdun beyond the reach of German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
artillery. To-day an army of a quarter of a million
of men, the enormous parks of heavy artillery and field
guns&mdash;everything is supplied by this one road and by
motor transport.</p>

<p>Coming north from St. Dizier we entered this vast
procession. Mile after mile the caravan stretched on,
fifty miles with hardly a break of a hundred feet between
trucks. Paris 'buses, turned into vehicles to bear fresh
meat; new motor trucks built to carry thirty-five men and
traveling in companies, regiments, brigades; wagons from
the hood of which soldiers, bound to replace the killed
and wounded of yesterday, looked down upon you calmly
but unsmilingly. From St. Dizier to Verdun the impression
was of that of the machinery by which logs are
carried to the saw in a mill. You felt unconsciously,
yet unmistakably, that you were looking, not upon automobiles,
not upon separate trucks, but upon some vast
and intricate system of belts and benches that were steadily,
swiftly, surely carrying all this vast material, carrying
men and munitions and supplies, everything human
and inanimate, to that vast grinding mill which was beyond
the hills, the crushing machine which worked with
equal remorselessness upon men and upon things.</p>

<p>Now and again, too, over the hills came the Red Cross
ambulances; they passed you returning from the front
and bringing within their carefully closed walls the finished
product, the fruits of the day's grinding, or a fraction
thereof. And about the whole thing there was a
sense of the mechanical rather than the human, something
that suggested an automatic, a machine-driven,
movement; it was as if an unseen system of belts and
engines and levers guided, moved, propelled this long
procession upward and ever toward the mysterious front
where the knives or the axes or the grinding stones did
their work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Night came down upon us along the road and brought
a new impression. Mile on mile over the hills and 'round
the curves, disappearing in the woods, reappearing on the
distant summits of the hills, each showing a rear light
that wagged crazily on the horizon, this huge caravan
flowed onward, while in the villages and on the hillsides
campfires flashed up and the faces or the figures of the
soldiers could be seen now clearly and now dimly. But
all else was subordinated to the line of moving transports.
Somewhere far off at one end of the procession there was
battle; somewhere down below at the other end there
was peace. There all the resources, the life blood, the
treasure in men and in riches of France were concentrating
and collecting, were being fed into this motor fleet,
which like baskets on ropes was carrying it forward to
the end of the line and then bringing back what remained,
or for the most part coming back empty, for more&mdash;for
more lives and more treasure.</p>

<p>It was full night when our car came down the curved
grades into Bar-le-Duc, halted at the corner, where soldiers
performed the work of traffic policemen and steadily
guided the caravan toward the road marked by a canvas
sign lighted within by a single candle and bearing the one
word, "Verdun." All night, too, the rumble of the passing
transport filled the air and the little hotel shook with
the jar of the heavy trucks, for neither by day nor by
night is there a halt in the motor transport, and the sound
of this grinding is never low.</p>


<h3>V&mdash;"TO VERDUN"&mdash;THE NEW CALVARY</h3>

<p>It was little more than daylight when we took the road
again, with a thirty-mile drive to Verdun before us. Almost
immediately we turned into the Verdun route we
met again the caravan of automobiles, of camions, as the
French say. It still flowed on without break. Now, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
we entered the main road, the one road to Verdun, the
road that had been built by the French army against just
such an attack as was now in progress. The road was
as wide as Fifth Avenue, as smooth as asphalt&mdash;a road
that, when peace comes, if it ever does, will delight the
motorist. Despite the traffic it had to bear, it was in perfect
repair, and soldiers in uniform sat by the side breaking
stone and preparing metal to keep it so.</p>

<p>The character of the country had now changed. We
were entering the region of the hills, between the Aisne
and the Meuse, a country reminiscent of New England.
Those hills are the barrier which beyond the Meuse, under
the names of the Côte de Meuse, have been the scene of
so much desperate fighting. The roads that sidled off to
the east bore battle names, St. Mihiel, Troyon, and the
road that we followed was still marked at every turn
with the magic word "Verdun." Our immediate objective
was Souilly, the obscure hill town twenty miles, perhaps,
south of the front, from which Sarrail had defended
Verdun in the Marne days and from which Pétain
was now defending Verdun against a still more terrible
attack.</p>

<p>And in France to-day one speaks only of Verdun and
Pétain. Soldiers have their day; Joffre, Castelnau, Foch,
all retain much of the affection and admiration they have
deserved, but at the moment it is the man who has held
Verdun that France thinks of, and there was the promise
for us that at Souilly we should see the man whose fame
had filled the world in the great and terrible weeks. Upward
and downward over the hills, through more ruined
villages, more hospitals, more camps, our march took us
until after a short hour we came to Souilly, general headquarters
of the Army of Verdun, of Pétain, the center
of the world for the moment.</p>

<p>Few towns have done less to prepare for greatness than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Souilly. It boasts a single street three inches deep in
the clay mud of the spring&mdash;a single street through which
the Verdun route marches almost contemptuously, the
same nest of stone and plaster houses, one story high,
houses from which the owners had departed to make room
for generals and staff officers. This and one thing more,
the Mairie, the town hall, as usual the one pretentious
edifice of the French hamlet, and before the stairway of
this we stopped and got out.</p>

<p>We were at headquarters. From this little building,
devoted for perhaps a century to the business of governing
the commune of Souilly, with its scant thousand of
people, Pétain was defending Verdun and the fate of an
army of 250,000 men at the least. In the upstairs room,
where the town councillors had once debated parochial
questions, Joffre and Castelnau and Pétain in the terrible
days of the opening conflict had consulted, argued,
decided&mdash;decided the fate of France, so the Germans
had said, for they had made the fall of Verdun the assurance
of French collapse.</p>

<p>Unconsciously, too, you felt the change in character
of the population of this village. There were still the
soldiers, the eternal gray-blue uniforms, but there were
also men of a different type, men of authority. In the
street your guides pointed out to you General Herr, the
man who had designed and planned and accomplished
the miracle of the motor transport that had saved Verdun&mdash;with
the aid of the brave men fighting somewhere
not far beyond the nearest hills. He had commanded at
Verdun when the attack came, and without hesitation he
had turned over his command to Pétain, his junior in
service and rank before the war, given up the glory and
become the superintendent of transport. Men spoke to
you of the fine loyalty of that action with unconcealed admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>And then out of the remoteness of Souilly there came
a voice familiar to an American. Bunau-Varilla, the man
of Panama, wearing the uniform of a commandant and
the Croix de Guerre newly bestowed for some wonderful
engineering achievement, stepped forward to ask for his
friends and yours of the old "Sun paper." I had seen
him last in "The Sun" office in the days when the war
had just broken out and he was about to sail for home;
in the days when the Marne was still unfought and he
had breathed hope then as he spoke with confidence now.</p>

<p>Presently there arrived the two officers whose duty it
was to take me to Verdun, Captain Henri Bourdeaux,
a man of letters known to all Frenchmen; Captain Madelin,
an historian, already documented in the history of the
war making under his own eyes....</p>


<h3>VI&mdash;"I STAND BEFORE GENERAL PETAIN"</h3>

<p>"Were we to see Verdun?" This was the first problem.
I had been warned two days before that the bombardment
was raging and that it was quite possible that
it would be unsafe to go further. But the news was reassuring;
Verdun was tranquil. "And Pétain?" One
could not yet say.</p>

<p>Even as we spoke there was a stirring in the crowd,
general saluting, and I caught a glimpse of the commander-in-chief
as he went quickly up the staircase. For
the rest we must wait. But not for very long; in a few
minutes there came the welcome word that General Pétain
would see us, would see the stray American correspondent.</p>

<p>Since I saw Pétain in the little Mairie at Souilly I
have seen many photographs of him, but none in any real
measure give the true picture of the defender of Verdun.
He saw us in his office, the bare upstairs room, two years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
ago the office of the Mayor of Souilly. Think of the
Selectmen's office in any New England village and the
picture will be accurate. A bare room, a desk, one chair,
a telephone, nothing on the walls but two maps, one of
the military zone, one of the actual front and positions
of the Verdun fighting. A bleak room, barely heated by
the most primitive of stoves. From the single window
one looked down on the cheerless street along which lumbered
the caravan of autos. On the pegs against the wall
hung the General's hat and coat, weather-stained, faded,
the clothes of a man who worked in all weathers. Of
staff officers, of uniforms, of color there was just nothing;
of war there was hardly a hint.</p>

<p>At the door the commander-in-chief met us, shook
hands and murmured clearly and slowly, with incisive
distinctness, the formal words of French greeting; he
spoke no English. Instantly there was the suggestion of
Kitchener, not of Kitchener as you see him in flesh, but
in photographs, the same coldness, decision. The smile
that accompanied the words of welcome vanished and the
face was utterly motionless, expressionless. You saw a
tall, broad-shouldered man, with every appearance of
physical strength, a clear blue eye, looking straight forward
and beyond.</p>

<p>My French companion, M. Le Roux, spoke with Pétain.
He had just come from Joffre and he told an interesting
circumstance. Pétain listened. He said now
and then "yes" or "no." Nothing more. Watching him
narrowly you saw that occasionally his eyes twitched a
little, the single sign of fatigue that the long strain of
weeks of responsibility had brought.</p>

<p>It was hard to believe, looking at this quiet, calm, silent
man, that you were in the presence of the soldier
who had won the Battle of Champagne, the man whom
the war had surprised in the last of his fifties, a Colonel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
a teacher of war rather than a soldier, a professor like
Foch.</p>

<p>No one of Napoleon's marshals had commanded as
many men as obeyed this Frenchman, who was as lacking
in the distinction of military circumstances as our own
Grant. Napoleon had won all his famous victories with
far fewer troops than were directed from the telephone
on the table yonder.</p>

<p>Every impression of modern war that comes to one actually
in touch with it is a destruction of illusion: this
thing is a thing of mechanism rather than of brilliance;
perhaps Pétain has led a regiment, a brigade, or a division
to the charge. You knew instinctively in seeing
the man that you would go or come, as he said, but there
was neither dash nor fire, nothing of the suggestion of
élan; rather there was the suggestion of the commander
of a great ocean liner, the man responsible for the lives,
this time of hundreds of thousands, not scores, for the
safety of France, not of a ship, but the man of machinery
and the master of the wisdom of the tides and the
weather, not the Ney, or the Murat, not the Napoleon of
Arcola. The impression was of a strong man whose life
was a life beaten upon by storms; the man on the bridge,
to keep to the rather ridiculously inadequate figure, but
not by any chance the man on horseback.</p>


<h3>VII&mdash;"MY TALK WITH THE GREAT FRENCH
GENERAL"</h3>

<p>My talk, our talk with Pétain was the matter of perhaps
five minutes.... Once he had greeted us his face
settled into that grim expression that never changed until
he smiled his word of good wishes as we left. Yet I
have since found that apart from one circumstance which
I shall mention in a moment I have remembered those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
minutes most clearly of all of my Verdun experience.
Just as the photograph does not reveal the face of the
man, the word does not describe the sense of strength, of
responsibility, that he gives.</p>

<p>In a childish sort of way, exactly as one thinks of war
as a matter of dash and color and motion, one thinks
of the French general as the leader of a cavalry charge
or of a forlorn hope of infantry. And the French soldier
of this war has not been the man of charge or of
dash&mdash;not that he has not charged as well as ever in his
history, a little more bravely, perhaps, for machine guns
are new and something worse than other wars have had.
What the French soldier has done has been to stand, to
hold, to die not in the onrush but on the spot.</p>

<p>And Pétain in some curious way has fixed in my mind
the impression of the new Frenchman, if there be a new
one, or perhaps better of the French soldier of to-day,
whether he wear the stars of the general or undecorated
"horizon" blue of the Poilu. The look that I saw in his
eyes, the calm, steady, utterly emotionless looking straight
forward, I saw everywhere at the front and at the back
of the front. It embodied for me an enduring impression
of the spirit and the poise of the French soldier of
the latest and most terrible of French struggles. And I
confess that, more than all I saw and heard at the front
and in Paris, the look of this man convinced me that
Verdun would not fall, that France herself would not
either weary or weaken.</p>

<p>In Paris, where one may hear anything, there are those
that will tell you that Joffre's work is done and that
France waits for the man who will complete the tasks;
that the strain of the terrible months has wearied the
general who won the Battle of the Marne and saved
France. They will tell you, perhaps, that Pétain is the
man; they will certainly tell you that they hope that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
man has been found in Pétain. As to the truth of all this
I do not pretend to know.</p>

<p>There was a Kitchener legend in Europe, and I do not
think it survives save a little perhaps in corners of England.
There was a legend of a man of ice and of iron,
a man who made victory out of human material as a
man makes a wall of mortar and stone, a man to whom
his material was only mortar and stone, even though it
were human. This legend has perished so far as Kitchener
is concerned, gone with so much that England
trusted and believed two years ago, but I find myself
thinking now of Pétain as we all thought of Kitchener in
his great day.</p>

<p>If I were an officer I should not like to come to the
defender of Verdun with the confession of failure. I
think I should rather meet the Bavarians in the first-line
trenches, but I should like to know that when I was
obeying orders I was carrying out a minor detail of something
Pétain had planned; I should expect it to happen,
the thing that he had arranged, and I should feel that
those clear, steel-blue eyes had foreseen all that could
occur, foreseen calmly and utterly, whether it entailed the
death of one or a thousand men, of ten thousand men if
necessary, and had willed that it should happen.</p>

<p>I do not believe Napoleon's Old Guard would have
followed Pétain as they followed Ney. I cannot fancy
him in the Imperial uniform, and yet, now that war is a
thing of machines, of telephones, of indirect fire and destruction
from unseen weapons at remote ranges, now
that the whole manner and circumstances of conflict have
changed, it is but natural that the general should change,
too. Patently, Pétain is of the new, not the old, but no
less patently he was the master of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>


<h3>VIII&mdash;TROOPS MARCHING TO THE SOUND OF
THE GUNS</h3>

<p>We left the little Mairie, entered our machines and slid
out swiftly for the last miles, climbed and curved over
the final hill and suddenly looked down on a deep, trenchlike
valley marching from east to west and carrying the
Paris-Verdun-Metz railroad, no longer available for traffic.
And as we coasted down the hill we heard the
guns ... not steadily, but only from time to time, a distant
boom, a faint billowing up of musketry fire. Some
three or four miles straight ahead there were the lines of
fire, beyond the brown hills that flanked the valley.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the valley we turned east, moved on
for a mile and stopped abruptly. The guns were sounding
more clearly, and suddenly there was a sense not of
soldiers, but of an army. On one side of the road a
column was coming toward us, a column of men who
were leaving the trenches for a rest, the men who for
the recent days had held the first line. Wearily but steadily
they streamed by; the mud of the trenches covered
their tunics; here and there a man had lost his steel helmet
and wore a handkerchief about his head, probably
to conceal a slight wound that but for the helmet had
killed him.</p>

<p>These men were smiling as they marched; they carried
their full equipment and it rattled and tinkled; they carried
their guns at all angles, they wore their uniforms in
the strangest of disorders; they seemed almost like miners
coming from the depths of the earth rather than soldiers
returning from a decisive battle, from the hell of
modern shell fire.</p>

<p>But it was the line on the other side of the road that
held the eye. Here were the troops that were going toward
the fire, toward the trenches, that were marching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to the sound of the guns, and as one saw them the artillery
rumble took on a new distinctness.</p>

<p>Involuntarily I searched the faces of these men as they
passed. They were hardly ten feet from me. Platoon
after platoon, company after company, whole regiments
in columns of fours. And seeing the faces brought an
instant shock; they all ... were in the thirties, not the
twenties; men still in the prime of strength, of health,
but the fathers of families, the men of full manhood.</p>

<p>Almost in a flash the fact came home. This was what
all the graves along the road had meant. This was what
the battlefields and the glories of the twenty months had
spelled&mdash;France had sent her youth and it was spent; she
was sending her manhood now.</p>

<p>In the line no man smiled and no man straggled; the
ranks were closed up and there were neither commands
nor any visible sign of authority. These men who were
marching to the sound of the guns had been there before.
They knew precisely what it meant. Yet you
could not but feel that as they went a little wearily, sadly,
they marched willingly. They would not have it otherwise.
Their faces were the faces of men who had taken
the full measure of their own fate.</p>


<h3>IX&mdash;"THEY HAD WILLED TO DIE FOR FRANCE"</h3>

<p>You had a sense of the loathing, the horror, above all
the sadness that was in their hearts that this thing, this
war, this destruction had to be. They had come here
through all the waste of ruined villages and shell-torn
hillsides; all the men that you saw would not measure
the cost of a single hour of trench fighting if the real
attack began. This these men knew, and the message
of the artillery fire, which was only one of unknown terrors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
for you, was intelligible to the utmost to each of
them.</p>

<p>And yet with the weariness there was a certain resignation,
a certain patience, a certain sense of comprehending
sacrifice that more than all else is France to-day,
the true France. This, and not the empty forts, not even
the busy guns, was the wall that defended France, this
line of men. If it broke there would come thundering
down again out of the north all the tornado of destruction
that had turned Northeastern France into a waste
place and wrecked so much of the world's store of the
beautiful and the inspiring.</p>

<p>Somehow you felt that this was in the minds of all
these men. They had willed to die that France might
live. They were going to a death that sounded ever
more clearly as they marched. This death had eaten
up all that was young, most of what was young at the
least, of France; it might yet consume France, and so
these men marched to the sound of the guns.... Instinctively
I thought of what Kipling had said to me in
London:</p>

<p>"Somewhere over there," he had said, "the thing will
suddenly grip your throat and your heart; it will take
hold of you as nothing in your life has ever done or ever
will." And I know that I never shall forget those lines
of quiet, patient, middle-aged men marching to the sound
of the guns, leaving at their backs the countless graves
that hold the youth of France, the men who had known
the Marne, the Yser, Champagne, who had known death
for nearly two years, night and day, almost constantly.
Yet during the fifteen minutes I watched there was not
one order, not one straggler; there was a sense of the
regularity with which the blood flows through the human
arteries in this tide, and it was the blood of France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>


<h3>X&mdash;"I CAN NEVER FORGET THOSE FACES"</h3>

<p>So many people have asked me, I had asked myself,
the question before I went to France: "Are they not
weary of it? Will the French not give up from sheer
exhaustion of strength?" I do not think so, now that
I have seen the faces of these hundreds of men as they
marched to the trenches beyond Verdun. France may
bleed to death, but I do not think that while there are
men there will be an end of the sacrifice. No pen or
voice can express the horror that these men, that all
Frenchmen, have of this war, of all war, the weariness.
They hate it; you cannot mistake this; but France
marches to the frontier in the spirit that men manned
the walls against the barbarians in the other days; there
is no other way; it must be.</p>

<p>Over and over again there has come the invariable answer;
it would have come from scores and hundreds
of these men who passed so near me I could have touched
their faded uniforms if I had asked&mdash;"It is for France,
for civilization; it must be, for there is no other way;
we shall die, but with us, with our sacrifice, perhaps this
thing will end." You cannot put it in words quite, I do
not think even any Frenchman has quite said it, but you
can see it, you can feel it, you can understand it, when
you see a regiment, a brigade, a division of these men
of thirty, some perhaps of forty, going forward to the war
they hate and will never quit until that which they love
is safe or they and all their race are swallowed up....
Under the crumbling gate of the Verdun fortress ...
as we entered a shell burst just behind us and the roar
drowned out all else in its sudden and paralyzing crash.
It had fallen, so we learned a little later, just where we
had been watching the passing troops; it had fallen among
them and killed. But an hour or two later, when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
repassed the point where it fell, men were still marching
by. Other regiments of men were still marching to the
sound of the guns, and those who had passed were already
over the hills and beyond the river, filing into the trenches
in time, so it turned out, to meet the new attack that
came with the later afternoon.</p>

<p>I went to Verdun to see the forts, the city, the hills
and the topography of a great battle; I went in the hope
of describing with a little of clarity what the operation
meant as a military affair.... But I shall never be able
to describe this thing which was the true Verdun for me&mdash;these
men, their faces, seen as one heard the shell fire
and the musketry rolling, not steadily but intermittently,
the men who had marched over the roads that are lined
with graves, through villages that are destroyed, who had
come of their own will and in calm determination and
marched unhurryingly and yet unshrinkingly, the men
who were no longer young, who had left behind them all
that men hold dear in life, home, wives, children, because
they knew that there was no other way.</p>

<p>I can only say to all those who have asked me, "What
of France?" this simple thing, that I do not believe the
French will ever stop. I do not believe, as the Germans
have said, that French courage is abating. I do not believe
the Kaiser himself would think this if he had seen
these men's faces as they marched <i>toward</i> his guns. I
think he would feel as I felt, as one must feel, that these
men went willingly, hating war with their whole soul,
destitute of passion or anger. I never heard a passionate
word in France, because there had entered into their
minds, into the mind and heart of a whole race, the belief
that what was at stake was the thing that for two
thousand years of history has been France.</p>

<h3>I&mdash;STORY OF ARRIVAL OF GENERAL
PERSHING ON FRENCH SOIL</h3>

<div class="right">
Boulogne, France, June 13, 1917.
</div>

<p>Cheering thousands, moved to tears, welcomed General
John J. Pershing on his arrival here to-day. The
tall, soldierly-appearing figure of Pershing, garbed in
the business-like khaki of the American army, was acclaimed
as France has seldom acclaimed another in all her
history. Frenzied crowds packed the streets to shout
their joy and wave the Tricolor of France with the same
three colors of the Star Spangled Banner. Gen. Pershing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
was welcomed at the dock by Gen. Pelletier, representing
the French Government and General Headquarters;
Commandant Hue, representing the Minister of
War; Gen. Lucas, commanding the northern region; Col.
Daru, Governor of Lille; the Prefect of the Somme and
other public officials.</p>

<p>Pershing arrived at 9:40 o'clock this morning. He
was deeply moved by the greeting he received.</p>

<p>"I consider this one of the most important moments
in American history," he said. "Our arrival on French
soil, constituting as we do the advance guard of an American
army, makes us realize to the fullest the importance
of America's participation. Our reception has moved
us deeply. I can only reaffirm that America has entered
the war with the intention of performing her full share&mdash;however
great or small the future will dictate. Our
Allies can depend upon that absolutely."</p>

<p>A small French boy who edged forward in the crowds
that greeted the American general was noticed by Pershing.
He wanted something and Pershing wanted to know
what it was. He came forward and shyly shook hands
with the big, smiling American and then asked him to
sign an autograph album, proudly displaying the signatures
which he had already obtained in it from Marshal
Joffre and Field Marshal Haig. Gen. Pershing stopped
right there and signed the book.</p>

<p>While Pershing and the commissioned officers of his
staff disembarked and were immediately taken away in
automobiles, non-commissioned officers and privates&mdash;orderlies
and attachés to the American General's entourage&mdash;swarmed
off the vessel and mixed joyously with the
crowd at the railway station. There were British Tommies
there to welcome their new brothers in arms&mdash;and
French poilus as well. Hundreds of handshakings&mdash;and
embraces&mdash;marked the meeting of these representatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of three great armies, now pledged to a common purpose.</p>

<p>Boulogne harbor was alive early in the morning awaiting
the arrival of the American General and his staff.
The first notice that the ship was finally arriving came
with the roar of salutes from French patrol boats in the
outer harbor. Then the British troopships hastily shifted
their anchorage to allow the boat with its all-important
cargo to dock at the principal wharf. There a huge
American flag was flung to the breeze from the topmost
part of the landing stage, while on the dock itself a brilliant,
colorful assembly awaited, cheering so that their
welcome must have been heard far out over the waters
as the boat slowly nosed her way between the whistle-shrieking
and gun-barking craft in between.</p>

<p>On the dock were British, French and Belgian officers,
formally drawn up in rigid salute as Gen. Pershing first
put his foot on French soil and gave evidence in the flesh
of America's determination to fight. Rene Besnard,
Under Secretary of War, was the Governmental representative
at this notable scene. He arrived from Paris
and shook hands with the American commander as he
stepped ashore. French Government officials formally
welcomed Gen. Pershing and his staff in the name of the
nation and the Americans were taken to a special train
en route for Paris.</p>


<h3>II&mdash;SCENES WHEN PERSHING ARRIVED IN
PARIS</h3>

<div class="right">
Paris, June 13, 1917.
</div>

<p>Paris, frantic with enthusiasm, streets massed with
throngs waving the American and French flags, greeted
Major-Gen. John J. Pershing and his staff here at 6:30
o'clock this evening. Marshal Joffre, former Premier
Viviani, Minister of War Painleve, American Ambassador<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Sharp and a score of other dignitaries greeted the
American commander and his officers at the Gare du
Nord.</p>

<p>"The living symbol of America's help in the war for
civilization."</p>

<p>"The man who will lead the American armies!"</p>

<p>Such were the tumultuous salutes.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands thronged the sidewalks from
the railway station, the Gare du Nord, to the Hotel Crillon,
where Gen. Pershing made his headquarters. From
the moment the automobile, in which he rode with Minister
of War Painleve and Gen. Pelletier, designated as his
honorary aide, moved slowly into the boulevard outside
the railway station, until he arrived at his hotel, the cheering
was continuous and, if possible, increased in volume,
and the crowds fairly smothered the Americans with
flowers.</p>

<p>As Gen. Pershing stepped on the railway platform he
found awaiting him M. Viviani, Minister Painleve, Marshal
Joffre, Gen. Foch, Gen. Dubail, Military Governor
of Paris; M. Mithouard, President of the Municipal
Council of Paris, and American Ambassador Sharp. M.
Mithouard spoke a few words of welcome. A company
of infantry was lined up as a guard of honor, and the
Republican Guard Band played "The Star Spangled Banner."
Gen. Pershing shook hands in the most cordial
fashion with M. Viviani and Marshal Joffre and remarked,
with a smile:</p>

<p>"It does not seem long since we saw you in Washington."</p>

<p>Then he was escorted to the Painleve automobile.
Ahead of it was that occupied by M. Viviani and Ambassador
Sharp, and behind one bearing Marshal Joffre and
Rene Besnard who had accompanied Gen. Pershing from
Boulogne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>From windows the Stars and Stripes were waved by
men, women and children. French girls, with flowers
bought from their savings, fought for a chance to hurl
their offerings into the laps of the astonished Americans.
The ride to the Hotel Crillon, in which suites for the
General and his chief officers had been reserved, lay
through many of the principal streets, and the motors
were driven slowly to afford the crowds a good look at
the Americans.</p>

<div class="right">
Paris, June 14, 1917.
</div>

<p>This was Pershing Day in Paris. The cheers which
greeted the American general's entry into the city yesterday
were re-echoed wherever he appeared to-day. All
gloom which has pervaded the city for months seemed to
dissipate wherever the tall figure of the American appeared.</p>

<p>When the General appeared on the Place de la Concorde
this morning he was wildly cheered by thousands
who lined the streets. He was escorted to the Palace of
the Elysée with military honors and was presented to
President Poincaré, after which he was entertained at
breakfast. Other guests were Premier Ribot, Gen. Painleve,
Marshal Joffre, Minister Viviani, Ambassador
Sharp and many prominent statesmen.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he was escorted to the Chamber of
Deputies by Ambassador Sharp. The unexpected appearance
of Gen. Pershing in the diplomatic gallery
turned a commonplace meeting of the Deputies into a
great ovation for the American General.</p>

<p>Premier Ribot, who had been discussing the Greek situation,
recognized Gen. Pershing and switched from his
speech, saying:</p>

<p>"We are confronted afresh by beholding the United
States coming to the rendezvous of the representatives of
a free people."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>As the Deputies leaped to their feet in honor of the
American General, the Premier continued:</p>

<p>"The people of Paris are so sure of themselves that in
their acclamation of Gen. Pershing they are writing the
first chapter in the history of the constitution of a society
of nations."</p>

<p>The Chamber turned with one accord to where Gen.
Pershing stood. He bowed his acknowledgments of the
Parliamentary greeting. Following Premier Ribot, Foreign
Minister Viviani said that "neither pen nor note
could do justice to the reception which he and Gen. Joffre
were accorded in the United States."</p>

<p>M. Viviani referred to President Wilson as "that great,
calm figure in whose untrembling hands there rests, with
Washington and Lincoln, all the grandeur of American
history."</p>

<p>A tremendous outburst of applause filled the auditorium
when M. Viviani told of how at Chicago, once
the center of pro-Germanism, he had been promised that
the last American and the last American dollar would be
given by the United States that France might restore Alsace-Lorraine.</p>

<p>This morning Gen. Pershing stood with uncovered head
at the tomb of Napoleon and paid tribute to one of the
world's greatest commanders. With his staff he was received
at the Hotel des Invalides by Gen. Niox, the commander,
and Gen. Malterre. As the American party entered
the spacious grounds leading to the building they
encountered a number of veterans. A grizzled soldier of
the Crimea saluted. Gen. Pershing stopped and extended
his hand, saying:</p>

<p>"It is a great honor for a young soldier like myself to
press the hand of an old soldier like yourself who has
seen such glorious service."</p>

<p>Gen. Niox conducted the American commander within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the vast rotunda, with its walls hung with battle flags,
and thence the party proceeded below to the crypt where
the sarcophagus of Napoleon reposes. Entrance to the
crypt is rigorously limited, and it is seldom that any one
is admitted except crowned heads or a former ruler, as
in the case of ex-President Roosevelt when he visited
Paris.</p>

<p>Gen. Pershing was then conducted to the Artillery
Museum, where precious relics of Napoleon are preserved.
He was particularly interested in Napoleon's
sword and Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor. An
hour was spent in the building.</p>

<p>To-night Gen. Painleve gave a dinner in honor of
Gen. Pershing. Among the guests were famous French
soldiers, Allied diplomats, residents in Paris, and French
statesmen.</p>


<h3>III&mdash;STORY OF ARRIVAL OF FIRST AMERICAN
TROOPS IN FRANCE</h3>

<div class="right">
Paris, July 1, 1917.
</div>

<p>Paris was overwhelmed with joy this morning at the
first published announcements that all of the first contingent
of United States troops had landed safely in
France. It was not long, either, until the city got a sight
of American sailors, marines and even a few regulars&mdash;soldiers
assigned to duty with various officers who have
come immediately to Paris from the port of landing.</p>

<p>Already the French are stirred to exultation and a
realization of the victory which they feel sure to come,
now that America has its fighting men so near the front.
The fraternization of the Americans with the English,
Canadians, Australians and French is remarkable, and
the new arrivals are being received everywhere with open
arms and open hearts. Last month nearly all the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
troops not having near relatives in the British Isles have
been coming to Paris on leave, and so the newly landed
Americans find plenty of comrades able to speak their
common language.</p>

<p>The Yankees warmed up particularly to the Canadians,
among whom are many Americans, but the greatest surprise
came at the way the French officers and poilus fraternize
with their new allies. The appearance of American
naval officers in white duck summer uniforms in the
smart Paris restaurants causes gasps of astonished delight.</p>

<p>The French press has extended an enthusiastic greeting
to the American troops. The <i>Temps</i> dwells upon
their youth, vigor, and military aspect, and the completeness
of their equipment.</p>

<p>The <i>Journal des Debats</i> says: "The grand democracy
of the New World does nothing by halves. It entered
this vast conflict in full consciousness of the ends to be
attained and with full resolution to neglect nothing in
attaining those ends. What we witness to-day in the arrival
of the Americans on French soil is magnificent proof
of this fact. Two months and a half after the Americans
entered the war their hardy troops arrive in solid lines
upon the European front, and it is not a modest advance
guard. On the contrary, the forces which have just
landed on our shore surpass anything which could reasonably
have been expected within so short a time. When
we recall the length of time it took England to move her
forces to South Africa, and, similarly, the length of time
it took us to move our troops to Salonica this remarkable
accomplishment by the Americans is seen in its full significance.
The material they bring is on the same abundant
scale as their troops. Those who have been doubtful
whether the American concourse would come in time
have failed to estimate at its just value the tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
moral and material American power that German brutality
has mobilized against itself. And what we see to-day
is only the commencement. Each day henceforth will
increase the weight of that formidable sword thrown into
the balance by the great Republic of America. Who can,
even in Germany, be blind to the inevitable consequences
of the events we are now witnessing?"</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;AMERICAN SOLDIERS CELEBRATE
FOURTH OF JULY IN PARIS</h3>

<div class="right">
Paris, July 4, 1917.
</div>

<p>All France celebrated the Fourth of July. Paris
turned out a crowd that no American city ever surpassed
for size, enthusiasm and profusion of Stars and Stripes.
A battalion of the first American expeditionary force
about to leave for training behind the battle front had its
first official review in France and was the centre of the
celebration. Everywhere the American flag was flying
from public buildings, hotels and residences and from
automobiles, cabs and carts, horses' bridles&mdash;even the
lapels of pedestrians' coats displayed it.</p>

<p>The crowds began early to gather at vantage points.
Rue de Varenne was choked long before 8 o'clock this
morning, when the Republican Guards Band carried out
a field reveille under Gen. Pershing's windows. All
routes toward the Hotel des Invalides were thronged
even before Pershing's men turned out. About the Court
of Honor where the Americans were drawn up with a
detachment of French Territorials, the buildings overflowed
with crowded humanity to the roofs. All around
the khaki-clad men from the United States were trophies
and souvenirs of war&mdash;German cannon, airplanes, machine
guns and many appliances for burning suffocating
gas. Behind them in the chapel separating the Court of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Honor from Napoleon's tomb were German battle flags,
trophies of the Marne and Alsace, beside Prussian banners
of 1870.</p>

<p>In the chapel before the tomb of Napoleon, Gen. Pershing
received American flags and banners from the hands
of President Poincaré. Almost the entire history of the
struggles of the French against the Germans looked down
upon the scene from paintings portraying heroic incidents
in French battles from Charlemagne to Napoleon. There
was a sharp contrast between the khaki and plain wide
brimmed hats of Pershing's men and the gay dress of
d'Artagnan's plumed musketeers and Napoleon's grenadiers.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm of the vast crowd reached its highest
pitch when Gen. Pershing, escorted by President Poincaré,
Marshal Joffre and other high French dignitaries,
passed along reviewing the lines of the Americans drawn
up in square formations. Cheering broke out anew
when the American band struck up "The Marseillaise,"
and again when the French band played "The Star-Spangled
Banner" and Pershing received the flags from
the President.</p>

<p>"Vive les Americains!" "Vive Pershing!" "Vive
les Etats-Unis!" shouted over and over by the crowd
greeted the American standard bearers as they advanced.</p>

<p>The crowd that had waited three hours to witness the
ceremony that was over in fifteen minutes, surged toward
the exit cheering frantically after the departing Americans
and trying to break through a cordon of police
troops. Outside a greater crowd that covered the entire
Esplanade des Invalides took up the cheers as Pershing's
men marched away. The crowd in the Court of Honor
tried to follow the soldiers, but the throng outside was
so dense, and the exits so small that it was half an hour
before the people could get out. The Cours de la Reine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
from Alexander Bridge to the Place de la Concorde was
black with people all of whom seemed to want to rush
up to the men and embrace them as they marched by.
When the last man had passed great crowds surged from
both sides to the middle of the street, breaking through
the police military guards and blocking traffic for a
long time behind the marching column.</p>

<p>More people were massed in the Tuileries Gardens
than on the Esplanade des Invalides. Few of them could
get a glimpse of the parade but all joined in a tremendous
outburst of cheering when music from the Republican
Guard Band announced the approach of the troops, and
the cheering did not diminish in volume until the last
man in the line had disappeared from view of the Gardens
down the Rue de Rivoli.</p>

<h2>WITH THE SERBIAN STOICS IN
EXILE&mdash;UNDER THE GERMAN YOKE</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Experiences in the Flight to Albania</i><br /><br />
<i>Told by Gordon Gordon-Smith, with the Serbian Army</i>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Gordon-Smith was with the armies of King Peter in the flight
into Albania. He stood beside the forlorn king as he fled with
his people before the German-Austrian-Bulgarian hordes. His
accounts of the hardships and heroism of the Serbs is the first
to reach the world. He tells about the tragic exodus through
the mountain passes&mdash;men, women and children; the babes and
the feeble on the procession of bullock carts; the wolves howling
through the night and gnawing at the bodies of the dead
along the road. A few of these stories are told here by permission
of the <i>New York Tribune</i>, for whom he acted as special
correspondent in the Balkans.</p></blockquote>


<h3>I&mdash;HOW I FLED WITH KING PETER'S TROOPS</h3>

<p>The headquarters of the Serbian Army left Krusevatz
for Rashka, as the German advance menaced its retreat
from the former town if longer delayed. With
my colleague of the <i>Petit Parisien</i> I determined to push
forward to join the Second Army, which was opposing
the enemy's advance in the valley of the Morava.</p>

<p>The roads were in a frightful condition. They were,
for the most part, mere cart tracks and perfect seas of
mud. The carriage half the time was ploughing through
two feet of tenacious clay. Twice it stuck fast up to the
axles in mud, and was only extricated with the friendly
aid of a passing bullock team. Good horses are no longer
to be had in Serbia; they have all been requisitioned for
the army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>One of our horses, a giraffe-like chestnut, is an ex-cavalry
horse of the Austrian army and bears the mark
of a wound from a shell splinter. It is named Julius.
Its partner (which I have named Cæsar) is a flea-bitten
gray, somewhat short in the wind. Both regard Serbian
mud and the effort it entails on them with profound
disapproval.</p>

<p>Just at the point where the road from Krusevatz joins
the main road running to Stalatz I came across half a
dozen British soldiers belonging to the heavy battery
which defended Belgrade. They were seated at the roadside
preparing the inevitable pot of tea without which
Tommy Atkins's happiness is not complete.</p>

<p>They told me their battery was en route for Nish and
that the guns had already been entrained at Stalatz. They
were covering the intervening sixty kilometres in a couple
of bullock carts. They were profoundly ignorant of what
was happening in Serbia or the outside world, but were
correspondingly cheerful.</p>

<p>They insisted on us sharing their tea, and produced
a pot of the equally inevitable marmalade, which they
proudly declared was one of the few objects which had
survived the bombardment of Belgrade. I left them
loading up their wagon and giving orders to their drivers
in weird but apparently effective Serbian.</p>

<p>It was dark when we reached Chichivatz, the first stage
on our journey. The problem was to find quarters and
food. Every village behind the front is filled to overflowing
with the fugitive population from the country
held by the Germans. Every public edifice is crammed;
people sleep on straw, twenty in a room, in every available
house. At the village inn the food supply resolved
itself into the inevitable "Schnitzel," which in the present
instance was a badly burnt piece of pork. We were,
however, fortunate enough to find the local station-master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
at the inn, who hospitably offered us a bedroom in the
railway station.</p>

<p>When we got there we noticed that he had already begun
to pack up ready to leave. With him was a young
official of the Ministry of Commerce, who had been sent
to destroy the stores and rolling stock....</p>

<p>As fast as the Germans advance in the north and the
Bulgarians in the south the locomotives and rolling stock
are accumulated on the only section of the line now in
Serbian hands; that is the 80 kilometres between Chichivatz
and Nish.</p>

<p>When everything is lost on this section the Serbian
authorities fill the whole track with rolling stock from
one end to the other and blow up all the bridges, so as to
render the line unworkable. The new American engines,
which were only delivered this year, have been placed
in a long tunnel on a side line, and each end of the
tunnel blown up, so as to entomb them undamaged....</p>

<p>Seven Serbian divisions opposing eighteen German
divisions were odds that not even the bravery of King
Peter's army could withstand. Train after train rolled
through the station loaded with military stores and
packed with fleeing peasants.</p>


<h3>II&mdash;"WE SADDLED OUR HORSES TO RIDE TO
THE FRONT"</h3>

<p>Next morning the station master roused me at 7:30
o'clock with the words, "The Germans are coming!"
From his tone one could have supposed the cavalry were
at the outskirts.</p>

<p>The real reason, I soon discovered, was his desire that
I should evacuate my sleeping quarters, as an ox wagon
was already at the door to transport the furniture to a
place of safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>We determined to leave the carriage to ride to the
front, as a carriage, in a sudden retreat, is apt to be
cumbersome. We accordingly saddled the horses and
rode to Parachine, twenty kilometers distant.</p>

<p>Parachine we found in a state of considerable excitement.
The thunder of the guns drawing nearer and
nearer gave evidence of the approach of the enemy. The
battle was raging about four miles outside the town.
The Second Army held the heights on both sides of the
valley, opposed to a force of nearly double its
strength....</p>

<p>As the staff of the Second Army was expected to arrive
in the town that evening we determined to remain
over night at Parachine. With thirty thousand refugees
in a town of twelve thousand inhabitants it was no easy
matter to find a room, but the Mayor kindly had a deserted
house broken open for us, and also, which was
even more important, found food and stabling for our
horses. Next morning the people of the next-door house
awakened us with the news that the Germans were attacking
the town, and that infantry fire was clearly audible.</p>

<p>When we got out we found the Serbian baggage train
pouring through the town&mdash;a clear sign that the retreat
had begun. The town was in wild excitement for two
reasons&mdash;firstly, on account of the approach of the Germans,
and, secondly, because orders had been given to
distribute to the inhabitants everything in the military
stores to prevent them falling into the hands of the enemy.
As a result I saw hundreds of people going about carrying
a dozen pairs of boots, uniforms, under-clothing,
bread, biscuits, etc.</p>

<p>At midday the provision and munition columns, having
safely cleared the town, General Stephanovitch and
his staff, after placing a strong rear guard to delay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
German advance as long as possible, left for Rajan, a
town about twenty miles distant.</p>

<p>The wildest reports were current. But it is no use
arguing with panic-stricken people. In spite of my assurances,
they went on loading carts and wagons in feverish
haste and, in spite of the pouring rain, went off in the
darkness. The curious thing is that not one in ten knew
where they were going. The Germans were coming from
the north, therefore they fled south.</p>


<h3>III&mdash;"I MET HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
REFUGEES"</h3>

<p>For a month past I have met hundreds of thousands
of such refugees, who wander on aimlessly from town
to town, driving flocks and herds before them, always
trying to keep a couple of days march in advance of the
invader.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that they add enormously to the
difficulties of the military situation. They block the
roads and overcrowd towns and villages. When their
food supplies run down they are face to face with starvation.
And when one remembers that a similar exodus
is going on from the south before the Bulgarian invader
the horror of the situation may be imagined....</p>

<p>The whole of Old Serbia, the Serbia of King Milan,
is in the hands of the Germans, while the Bulgarians are
masters of nearly the whole of Serbian Macedonia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I had hardly been asleep half an hour when I was
aroused by a tremendous explosion, followed a quarter
of an hour later by a succession of minor explosions.
These were caused by the blowing up of the ammunition
wagons. The crimson glare announced that the scores
of cars on the railway siding were ablaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time an engine just opposite my windows
began whistling stridently. Downstairs in the courtyard
I found the whole population, male and female, old and
young, busy looting the carriages and trucks not yet a
prey to the flames.</p>

<p>Half a dozen wagons filled with boots for the Rumanian
army, which had been lying in the siding for
three months, were being plundered. Two other wagons
filled with 50,000 francs' worth of cigarette papers,
wagons filled with Serbian wine, French champagne, liqueurs
and perfumery, were also given over to plunder.
Thousands of bags of flour, boxes of biscuits, tinned
meats and sardines covered the ground on all sides, while
the inhabitants of the village were loading carts and
handbarrows.</p>

<p>These people were not worrying much about the approach
of the Germans. As they had determined to be
taken prisoners, they regarded the advance of the invaders
philosophically.</p>

<p>My chief worry was Varvarian, which I could see only
four miles away. It had been occupied at dawn by the
German cavalry, and, of course, they might risk a sudden
dash for Chichivatz, and perhaps even Salatz, down
the line.</p>

<p>We therefore determined to return at once for Krusevatz.
The press of vehicles on the road was so great
that we saw we could proceed quicker on foot, so we
left the carriage to follow and started to cover the intervening
twenty kilometres.</p>

<p>When we reached Krusevatz, late in the afternoon, we
found the town apparently in high festival. Everybody
seemed in the best of humor and gaiety reigned
everywhere.</p>

<p>We soon discovered the cause. The whole town, men,
women and children, had been drinking unlimited quantities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of French champagne, a trainful of which was lying
in the station. When the capture of the town was seen
to be inevitable orders were given there, as elsewhere,
to let the population plunder everything in sight, and the
order had been faithfully obeyed.</p>

<p>I doubt, however, if this had the effect of preventing
the goods falling into the hands of the Germans. The
latter would not be long in hearing of what had happened.
They would simply post up a notice to the inhabitants
telling them to bring back all the plunder to
the "Kommandatur," twelve bullets being provided for
any one who should fail to do so. This, plus the threat
of a house-to-house search to discover those who had
failed to obey, would probably rake in nine-tenths of the
goods.</p>

<p>The great retreat of the Serbian army across the mountains
had now begun. With their 300,000 bayonets, in
spite of the fact that the Teutons were, as far as physique
went, the most miserable material it was ever my
lot to see, they continually outflanked the 150,000 men
the Serbians were able to oppose to them.</p>

<p>The Serbian armies, except the division which was
opposing the Bulgarians in the south, were forced back
on the mountain range, which at this point runs transversely
across Serbia, and behind which lies the old
Turkish province, the Sandpak of Novi Bazar, and the
Plain of Kossovo.</p>

<p>The operation of conducting the retreat of the Serbian
armies through the mountain passes was like filtering
a fifty-gallon cask through the neck of a pint
bottle. The transport of 20,000 ox-drawn army service
wagons, whose best gait is about two miles an hour,
alone constituted a formidable problem.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In view of the terrible nature of the roads, we had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
add a third horse to the team of our carriage. A mile
from the town we found ourselves in a mass of wagons,
which every instant became more congested. The passage
of tens of thousands of guns and wagons had
churned the roads into a huge quagmire.</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;"I WATCHED THE TERRIFYING
SPECTACLE"</h3>

<p>As darkness fell the scene became a sinister one. To
the left, behind the railway station, one building after
another burst into flame; the employees were firing the
storehouses and blowing up the wagons on the siding.
A few minutes later the whole town was shaken by a
series of explosions. The accumulated stocks in the
Obelitchavo powder magazine were being blown up.</p>

<p>From the eminence on which I stood the spectacle was
terrifying. Krusevatz was blazing at half a dozen points,
the whole sky was covered with a crimson glare, while
below us the river, like red blood in the flames, could
be followed to the horizon, where the flashes of Serb
guns delaying the German advance could be seen.</p>

<p>On the line of retreat confusion was becoming worse.
The whole road was filled with a triple line of bullock
wagons, their panting teams straining to tear them
through the tenacious mud.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came an explosion like an earthquake.
An immense column of yellow flame shot heavenward.
The heavy girder bridge over the river had been dynamited.
At the same instant three immense German shells
came screaming overhead and burst with tremendous
explosions, one near the town hall and two near the railway
station. These nerve-shaking explosions caused a
wild panic, the first I had seen in Siberia. The terrified
oxen broke into a run and poured in a surging mass,
with my carriage in their midst, down the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly they came on a narrow bridge spanning a
small ravine. Those on the outside were forced against
the parapet. I saw the carriage balance for an instant
and then with the three horses roll into the ditch thirty
feet below. There was a sound of smashing glass, and
it was all over with our vehicle.</p>

<p>The only thing was to extricate the kicking horses
and salve such baggage as had escaped. This was a long
and difficult process in torrents of rain, but after an
hour and a half of hard work we finally got our belongings
ranged alongside the road.</p>

<p>The next difficulty was a means of transport, but an
obliging non-commissioned officer to the Reserve Munition
Column of the Timok Division stopped a half-empty
ox wagon and our belongings were hoisted in.
We in turn found shelter under the tilt of another wagon
and made ourselves as comfortable as the munition boxes
would allow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The German infantry was of miserable quality, men
who a year ago would never have passed the doctor,
they burst their way through by shell and shrapnel fire.</p>

<p>It was during these attacks that they took hundreds of
prisoners, all of them, as I have said, of miserable physique.
I saw a youth in the streets of Krusevatz, who
could not have been more than sixteen or seventeen years
old. His "pickelhauben," much too large for him, came
down over his ears. Another I saw was minus a finger
on his left hand, and a French surgeon told me he had
a German patient who was deaf and dumb. All were
pale-faced, narrow-chested, and not the class of men one
saw twelve months ago.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then came the blizzards of snow and inundations which
blotted out the road in districts hundreds of kilometers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
in extent. Add to this fact, all communication with the
outside world was completely cut off, there were no letters,
telegrams or newspapers, and such vague reports as
filtered in were brought by circuitous routes over hundreds
of kilometers of the worst roads in Europe.</p>

<p>With every trump card in the hands of her enemies,
Serbia's fate was sealed. All she could do was to fight
to the last, and this she did.</p>


<h3>V&mdash;EVERY ROAD WAS FILLED WITH HUMAN
MISERY</h3>

<p>Every road in Serbia was filled with the flowing tide
of human misery. Every town and village was overcrowded.
In Kroljevo in ordinary times there are 15,000.
When I reached the town it contained 120,000. The same
held good of every other center.</p>

<p>The government issued a decree ordering all the male
population above fourteen to leave the invaded districts
before the arrival of the enemy. This added nearly a
million to the number of people the government had to
support, and under the strain the civil administration
broke down completely. Soon the old Serbia of King
Milas was completely in the hands of the Germans, while
the Bulgarians drove out the population of Serbian Macedonia.</p>

<p>As a consequence the only refuge left was Novi Bazar.
Into this narrow space poured an endless tide of refugees.
Gaunt, hollow-eyed men, women and children dragged
themselves wearily for hundreds of kilometers, bound
they knew not whither. Always behind them they heard
the inexorable thunder of the guns, warning them to
press on and on. Thousands fell by the wayside, succumbing
to cold and hunger.</p>

<p>Probably not since the crossing of the Alps by Napoleon
has such a military expedition been undertaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
as the traversing of the Albanian Mountains by the headquarters
staff and the remains of the Serbian army.</p>

<p>The sight presented by Lium Koula on the eve of departure
was unique. On the mountain side for miles
nothing could be seen but endless fires. They were made
by thousands of ox wagons, unable to go further, as the
road for vehicles ceases there. Fortunately the snowstorm
ended and was followed by brilliant sunshine.</p>

<p>Next day at 9 o'clock the headquarters staff set out.
It included 300 persons and 400 pack animals. The road
wound along the banks of the Drin, which had to be
crossed twice by means of picturesque old single-span
Turkish bridges, since destroyed to impede the Bulgarian
advance.</p>

<p>The first mistake was that of transporting the sedan
chair of Field Marshal Putnik at the head of the procession.
Every time it halted to change bearers, which
was every fifteen minutes, the whole two-mile-long procession,
following in single file, had to stop also. As
a result, instead of reaching Spas before sundown, we
only reached the base of the mountain after darkness
had fallen.</p>

<p>Here a long council was held as to whether we should
bivouac in the village below or undertake the mountain
climb in the dark. The latter course was decided upon.
It was one of the most extraordinary adventures ever
undertaken. A narrow path, about four feet across, covered
with ice and snow, winds corkscrew fashion up the
face of the cliff. On one hand is a rocky wall and on
the other a sheer drop into the Drin.</p>


<h3>VI&mdash;OVER THE MOUNTAIN SIDE WITH
GENERAL PUTNIK</h3>

<p>This road winds and twists in all sorts of angles, and
it was up this that we started in the black darkness, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the sedan chair of General Putnik still heading the procession.
Every time it reached a corner it was a matter
of endless difficulty to manoeuver it around.</p>

<p>On one occasion we stood for thirty-five minutes in
an icy wind listening to the roar of the Drin, invisible in
the black gulf 500 feet below. Horses slipped and fell
at every instant, and every now and then one would go
crashing into the gulf below.</p>

<p>It was 10 o'clock when, tired, hungry and half frozen,
we reached bivouac at Spas. Here we found that though
dinner had been ready since 3 o'clock it could not be
served because all the plates and spoons were on the pack
animals, which remained in the village below. Neither
had the tents arrived, and as Spas contains only five or
six peasant houses accommodation was at a premium.
Colonel Mitrovitz, head of the mess, told me I would
find room in a farmhouse a quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p>The house really was two hours distant, over fields
deep in snow. When I got there at midnight I discovered
that there were already nearly a score of occupants; but
at least I was able to sleep in some straw near the fireside,
instead of in the snow outside.</p>

<p>Next morning I set out at 6 to get ahead of the main
body of the headquarters staff. The day was magnificent
and we slowly climbed foot by foot to the cloud-capped
summits of the mountains. Up and up we went, thousands
and thousands of feet.</p>

<p>Every few hundred yards we came on bodies of men
frozen or starved to death. At one point there were
four in a heap. They were convicts from Prisrend penitentiary,
who had been sent in chains across the mountains.
They had been shot either for insubordination or
because they were unable to proceed. Two other nearly
naked bodies were evidently those of Serbian soldiers
murdered by Albanians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>


<h3>VII&mdash;"I OVERTOOK KING PETER"</h3>

<p>Soon after midday I overtook King Peter and his
staff. Despite his seventy-six years, he marched on foot
with vigor younger men might have envied.</p>

<p>During all the four hours I marched with the royal
staff he never once mounted his horse, which a soldier
was leading behind him. When we stopped for the night
at Bredeti King Peter had a ten hours' march to his
credit.</p>

<p>It was at this point I came across the first of Essad
Pacha's gendarmes. They had been sent out by that
heavy-handed ruler to protect the King and his staff.
They were a picturesque lot, many of them barefooted,
but there was no doubt about the first class quality of
their rifles and revolvers. They wore the Serbian gendarme's
uniform&mdash;that is, they wore any uniform&mdash;of
which the Nish government had some months before
made them a present of several thousand.</p>

<p>The attitude of the population could not be described
as friendly to the Serbians, but at the same time there
were no outward signs of hostility. They rarely saluted
and showed no desire whatever to offer hospitality. In
the case of the royal household and headquarters staff
Essad Pacha had requisitioned accommodations, but any
one not belonging to one of these units had every chance
of faring badly. All they had to depend on were wayside
caravanserai.</p>

<p>These huge, barnlike structures consist of nothing but
four walls and a roof, the latter generally doubtfully
water-tight. Here men and horses were all quartered
pell-mell. Everybody annexes as much space as he can
get and lights a fire for warmth and cooking. As they
have no chimneys, the smoke is left to find its way out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
through the open doors or the thatched roof. The state
of the atmosphere may be imagined.</p>

<p>As my colleague, Paul Dubochet, of the "Petit Parisien,"
and I had pushed on ahead of the headquarters
staff, we had naturally lost the advantage of being billeted
by Essad's gendarmes. When we finished the day's
march we took our share of floor space, but the atmosphere
in an hour generally proved too much for
us.</p>

<p>We were therefore compelled to surrender, and, despite
the freezing cold and the driving snow, we determined
to put up a small tent I received at the time of
the destruction of the military stores at Kraguyevatz
Arsenal. It was only three feet high and open at the
end; hence it was only an indifferent shelter against the
blizzard. However, I ordered my man to build an immense
fire near the open end, and we went to sleep.</p>

<p>Three hours later we awoke, to find the wretched tent
ablaze. We struggled out with difficulty and managed to
save most of our belongings, but the tent and the sleeping
rugs were gone. There was nothing to do but remain
at our camp fire until dawn.</p>


<h3>VIII&mdash;A THOUSAND MEN AND HORSES OVER
A ROCKY GORGE</h3>

<p>On the next march a new experience awaited us. The
road ran for miles through a rocky gorge, and nothing
else. The bed of the river was the only means of travel.
There is nothing so nerve-racking as to keep one's eyes
constantly glued to the ground, when each step presents
a new problem. Of course, every now and then one of
the stones would turn under our feet, and this meant a
plunge up to the knees in icy water.</p>

<p>So far as the eye could see there was nothing but this
rocky bed, winding between towering basaltic cliffs. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
task of transporting a thousand men and horses under
such conditions was almost superhuman. If the Albanians
had been openly hostile not one man would have
come out alive.</p>

<p>The Albanian, like most peasants, is grasping and fond
of money, but once you cross his threshold your person
and property are sacred. I never had the slightest fear
once I entered an Albanian house.</p>

<p>On the road everything is possible. The tribes live
at war with one another and respect for human life is
non-existent. It would have been as much as our lives
were worth to travel an hour after darkness. But during
the daylight an armed party inspires a certain respect.</p>

<p>The men physically are probably the handsomest in
Europe. I have never seen anywhere such beautiful
children as those of the Albanians. Not one in a hundred
knows how to read or write or has even been more
than twenty miles from home.</p>

<p>It was through such a country the Serbians had to
transport soldiers, and that with the Germans and the
Bulgarians in close pursuit.</p>

<p>The last stages of the march were probably the hardest,
as fodder for the animals and food for the men
was practically unprocurable. Money difficulties also increased
daily, the Albanians refusing to accept Serbian
script at any rate of exchange. They would, however,
give food and lodgings for articles of clothing, shirts,
underwear, socks and boots. On the last stage we had,
therefore, to resort to the primitive system of barter, buying
a night's lodging with a shirt and a meal with a pair
of socks.</p>


<h3>IX&mdash;WOLVES LIVING ON CARCASSES IN
MOUNTAIN PASSES</h3>

<p>In the mountains just before Puka I discovered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
first trace of wolves. The carcasses of dead horses,
which were now numbered by scores, showed signs of
having been torn by them. A part of the French aviation
corps, which was preceding us, got lost in the snow
and darkness, and had to spend the night in the open
without protection. A dozen were frostbitten, but no
fatal casualties. After six days we finally reached the
Drina again, a swiftly flowing stream.</p>

<p>Thence the march to Scutari may be summed up in the
word mud&mdash;mud of the deepest and most tenacious kind,
sometimes only reaching to the ankles, sometimes to the
knees, but it was always there.</p>

<p>The twenty-five miles between the Drina ferry and
Scutari represents physical effort of no mean order. It
was the finish for scores of unfortunate pack horses.
During the last two days they got practically no food.
On these days we found dead horses every hundred
yards. When at last, at 4 in the afternoon, we came in
sight of the towers and minarets of Scutaria every one
heaved a sigh of relief. The streets presented a wonderful
sight, being thronged with Serbian soldiers, mixed
with French aviators, men of the French and Serbian
medical staff and scores of the Red Cross unit&mdash;British,
French, Russian and Greek.</p>

<p>Scutari's normal population of 40,000 had been increased
by 100,000 Serbian and other refugees. Food
was running scarce, and there were practically no accommodations.
The unfortunate diplomatic corps was
scattered all over in such lodgings as could be found for
it. The headquarters staff took possession of the Hotel
De la Ville. I learned the Danube division, which had
entered Albania by Montenegro, had performed the
miracle of saving part of its field artillery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fate of Serbia was worse than that of Belgium,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
for to King Albert's subjects there always remained
France, England and Holland as havens of refuge. For
King Peter's people there was none. On the one hand,
the inhospitable mountains of Montenegro offered a barrier
which the starving people were powerless to cross.
On the other was the desolation of the snow-capped peaks
of Albania, with a population sullenly hostile to Serbia
and everything Serbian.</p>

<p>But even if they had been willing to welcome them
with open arms they could not have helped them, as the
mountaineers of Albania live themselves all their lives
on the ragged edge of starvation. The catastrophe, therefore,
was beyond human aid, and Serbia had to drink
the cup of bitterness to the dregs and witness the foundering
of all that was left of her manhood and national
wealth. It was the death agony of one of the bravest
nations in Europe, of a people who had for five long
years fought four victorious wars for its national existence,
and at last succumbed to a combination of forces
three times stronger than itself.</p>

<h2>TALES OF THE TANKS&mdash;WITH THE
ARMORED MONSTERS IN BATTLE</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Adventures as Romantic as Mediaeval Legends</i><br /><br />
<i>Told by the Men in the Tanks</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>Here are four tales as strange as "Arabian Nights" direct from
the great battles of the Somme. It was on these battlegrounds
that armored monsters plunged into the enemies' ranks, spitting
flame and death, and creating consternation among the German
soldiers. These armored tractors are an American invention.
While the huge death-machines were constructed in England,
they were built on plans from the United States. It was for
divulging secrets about these tractors that Mlle. Mata Hari, the
Dutch-Javanese dancer, was arrested in Paris as a spy and
sentenced to execution.</p></blockquote>


<h3>I&mdash;STORY OF A YOUNG AUSTRALIAN IN A
TANK ON THE BATTLEFIELD</h3>

<p>Monday.&mdash;Out for first time. Strange sensation.
Worse than being in a submarine. At first unable to see
anything but imagined a lot. Bullets began to rain like
hailstones on a galvanized roof at first, then like a series
of hammer blows. We passed through it all unscathed.</p>

<p>Suddenly we gave a terrible lurch. I thought we were
booked through. Lookout said we were astride an enemy
trench. "Give them hell!" was the order. We gave them
it. Our guns raked and swept trenches right and left.</p>

<p>Got a peep at frightened Huns. It was grimly humorous.
They tried to bolt like scared rabbits, but were shot
down in bunches before getting to their burrows. Machine
guns brought forward. Started vicious rattle on
our "hide." Not the least impression was made. Shells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
began to burst. We moved on and overtook some more
frightened Huns. Cut their ranks to ribbons with our
fire.</p>

<p>They ran like men possessed. Officer tried to rally
them. They awaited our coming for a while. As soon
as our guns began to spit at them they were off once
more. Infantry rounded them up and survivors surrendered.
Very curious about us. Stood open mouthed and
wide eyed watching, but weren't much the wiser.</p>

<p>Experience was not altogether pleasant at first. Tank
sickness is as bad as sea sickness until you get used to
it.</p>

<p>Tuesday.&mdash;Off for another cruise. Peppering begun at
once. Thought old thing was going to be drowned in
shower of bullets. Things quiet down quickly. Silly
blighters thought they could rush the tank like they would
a fort. Dashed up from all sides. We fired at them
point blank. Devilish plucky chaps some of them, for all
their madness. The survivors had another try. We spat
at them venomously. More of them went down.</p>

<p>The blessed old tub gave a sudden jerk. God in heaven,
thought I, it's goodby to earth; but it wasn't. Only
some Hun dead and wounded we had skidded into. The
rain of bullets resumed. It was like as if hundreds of
rivets were being hammered into the hide of the tank.
We rushed through. Soon the music had charms, and
we got to like the regular rhythm of it.</p>

<p>Suddenly a jolt, and our hearts jolted in our mouths
in sympathy. Nothing doing in the mishap line. Only
some unwonted obstacle. Heavier "strumming" on our
keyboard outside, and more regular. Machine guns at it
now. Straddled on as though we like it. A tremendous
thud. The whole outfit seemed done for. Nearly jumped
out of my skin. Looked at each other and wondered
what it was. Still a roof over our heads, thank God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Wednesday.&mdash;Early start. Roughest voyage yet.
Waves of fire seemed to break over us. Tremendous
crash. Then another, and several others at intervals.
Silence for a time. Party of Huns came to meet us outside
the village. Very stout old gentleman in front.
Thought it was the Mayor and village bigpots to give us
a civic welcome. Mistaken. They meant to give warm
reception, but not as we understood the word. Let fly
with machine guns. Then tried silly boarding tactics.
We laughed. Our guns answered theirs.</p>

<p>Tank reception committee dispersed in a cloud of
smoke and flame; no trailing clouds of glory. Fat old
gentleman only visible member of deputation. Stood
openmouthed. Purple with rage. Tank bore down. Old
gent started to run. Funnier than a sack race. Old gent
flung himself to earth with many signs to surrender.</p>

<p>Thursday.&mdash;Got into the village, and passed down between
two irregular rows of wrecked houses. Hundreds
of Huns came rushing up from cellars and from behind
ruins to see us. Some had eyes staring out of head.
Looked surprised and even frightened.</p>

<p>One blighter made a rush at us with a clubbed rifle.
Made a terrible swipe at the tank. Smashed his rifle,
and made a nasty noise on our roof. Hurt himself more
than he hurt us. Off for a joy ride after some nice Huns
who took to flight as we came up.</p>

<p>Friday.&mdash;Early afloat. Usual showers of bullets and a
few shells on the way. Got right across a trench. Made
the sparks fly. Went along parapet routing out Huns
everywhere. Enemy terrified. Tried to run, but couldn't
keep it up under our fire. Threw up the sponge and
surrendered in batches.</p>

<p>One cheeky chap said he didn't think it was fair to
fight with such things. We said that was our affair, and
we could stand the racket Germany cared to make over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
it. Asked one chap if the thought we should have got
permission from the Kaiser before using them. Didn't
see the joke. Took about two hundred prisoners. Killed
and wounded as many more. Tired out when through.</p>

<p>Saturday.&mdash;On the move before breakfast. Terrible
crash on first go off. Thought we had collided with a
wandering world. Weathered the storm. Got busy on
enemy trenches. Rare good sport. Enemy tried a surprise
for infantry&mdash;Yorkshiremen&mdash;advancing to attack.
We tried a surprise, too, and ours came off first. Huns
weren't pleased. Didn't think it was playing the game
according to Potsdam rules.</p>

<p>We waddled into their ambush for the attacking troops.
Never saw men so frightened. Fled panic-stricken in all
directions. Only a few chaps stayed behind and tried
to stop us by machine gun fire. Smashed them to bits
and left their machine guns to be picked up by the Yorkshiremen
they hoped to surprise.</p>

<p>Went snorting after the enemy wherever we could find
them. Their losses were terrible. Later strong detachments
tried to make their way back, supported by big
guns. Lined up across the road and gave them hot time.
Every time they tried to rush through we ripped their
ranks to bits. At last they gave it up. Very wise.</p>

<p>Sunday.&mdash;Good work of frightening Huns continued.
Better day, better deed. Fritz didn't think that. Blighters
opened rifle fire on us at two hundred yards. It
went like water off a duck's back. Fritz couldn't make
it out. Kept up the fire, but got a bit nervy as the blessed
old thing kept waddling up to him. Ladled out death
as you might vamp out indifferent music from a hurdy-gurdy.</p>

<p>Fritz got fits. No fight left in him. Prisoners scared
to death. Some of them acted as though they believed
that we used our tanks for making sausages out of prisoners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
We had a lot of trouble explaining that once they
surrendered they were safe.</p>

<p>Finished an exciting week. Got plenty of fun, but one
wants a good rest after a spell with a tank.</p>


<h3>II&mdash;STORY OF THE TANKS THAT STORMED A
CASTLE</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Told by Philip Gibbs, War Correspondent, in France</i></div>

<p>After the battle of Flanders the tank pilots have been
able to tell the tale of their adventures after a spell of
rest, badly needed by the young men, who crawled out of
their steel boxes speechless, bruised and dazed.</p>

<p>For seventeen hours one of the tank pilots and his
crew stayed out, fighting all the time, and for twenty-four
hours another crew went through, not with incessant
fighting, but bogged and unbogged, and struggling
on and getting into action and slouching back after a good
record of achievement.</p>

<p>The tanks have justified themselves again and won
their spurs&mdash;spurs as big as gridirons.</p>

<p>In the battle of Flanders they had plenty of chance
to show what they could do. The way of the allied advance
was hindered by a number of little concrete forts
built in the ruins of farmsteads, which had withstood the
British gunfire. At Plum Farm and Apple Villa and in
the stronger and more elaborate fortified points like
Frezenberg and Pommern Castle and Pommern Redoubt
the German machine gunners held out when everything
about them was chaos and death, and played a barrage
of bullets on the advancing Allies. Platoons and half
platoons attacked them in detail at great cost of life, and
it was in such places that the tanks were of the most
advantage.</p>

<p>It was at Pommern Castle, east of St. Julien, that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of the tanks did its best. Do not imagine the castle as a
kind of structure with big walls and portcullis and high
turrets, but slabs of concrete in a huddle of sandbags
above a nest of deep dugouts. On the other side of it
was Pommern Redoubt, of the same style of defense.</p>

<p>The British were fighting hard for the castle and having
a bad time under its fire. A tank came to help them
and advanced under the swish of bullets to the German
emplacements, lurching up the piled bags over the
heaped-up earth and squatting on the top like a grotesque
creature playing the old game of "I'm king of the
castle. Get down, you dirty rascals."</p>

<p>The "dirty rascals," who were German soldiers, unshaven
and uncovered in the wet mud, did not like the
look of their visitors, who were firing with great ferocity.
They fled to the cover of Pommern Redoubt, beyond.
Then the tank moved back to let the infantry get in, but
as soon as it turned its back the Germans, with renewed
pluck, took possession of the castle again.</p>

<p>The men who were fighting round about again gave the
signal to the tank to "get busy" so it came back, and,
with the infantry on its flanks, made another assault, so
that the Germans fled again.</p>

<p>The Pommern Redoubt was attacked in the same way,
with good help from the tanks.</p>

<p>Frezenberg Redoubt was another place where the tanks
were helpful, and they did good work at Westhoek.</p>

<p>One of them attacked and helped to capture a strong
point west of St. Julien from which a good many Germans
came out to surrender. Afterward some tanks
went through the village, but they had to get out again
in a hurry to escape capture in the German counterattacks.</p>

<p>It was not easy to get back in a hurry, as by that hour
in the afternoon the rain had turned the ground to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
swamp and the tanks sank deep in it with the wet mud
half-way up their flanks and slipped and slithered back
when they tried to struggle out. Many of the officers
and crew had to get out of their steel forts, risking the
heavy shelling and machine-gun fire, to dig their way
out; and in the neighborhood of St. Julien they worked
for two hours in the open to debog their tank, while the
Germans tried to destroy them by direct hits.</p>

<p>In a farm somewhere in this neighborhood no fewer
than sixty Germans came out with their hands up in
surrender as soon as a tank was at close quarters. The
story is told that at another place the mere threat of a
tank's approach was enough to decide a party of eight
to give in. It is certain beyond all doubt that the German
infantry has great fear of the "beasts."</p>

<p>In this battle there was not a single case of attack
upon a tank by infantry, although we know that they
have been training behind their lines with dummy tanks,
according to definite rules laid down by the German
command.</p>

<p>One fight did take place with a tank, and it was surely
the most fantastic duel that had happened in the war. It
was queer enough, as I described a day or two ago when
one of the British airmen flew over a motor car and
engaged in a revolver duel with the German officer, but
even that strange picture is less weird than when a German
airplane flew low over a tank and tried to put out
its "eyes" by a burst of machine gun bullets.</p>

<p>Imagine the scene, that muddy monster, crawling
through the slime with sharp stabs of fire coming from
its flanks and above an engine with wings, swooping
round and about it like an angry albatross and spattering
its armor with bullets. It was an unequal fight, for the
tank just ignored that waspish machine-gun fire and
went on its way with only a scratch or two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>The tanks were in action around the marshes and
woodlands by Shrewsbury Forest. Here there was very
severe infantry fighting and the Germans made desperate
resistance, followed by many counterattacks, so that the
progress of the British was slow and difficult and the
tanks helped them as best they could.</p>

<p>One trouble of the tanks is their limited vision, and
this and the darkness before the battle were the cause
of an unexpected collision, which adds to the strange
history of the mechanical monsters, so that it is all beyond
the wildest flight of imagination.</p>

<p>One of the tanks was crawling up to get into position
for attack, and unaware that it was bearing steadily down
upon one of those light railway engines which I saw
steaming along in the centre of the Ypres salient on the
morning of battle. It was grunting and whistling so that
it could be heard a mile away, but not a sound of it came
to the ears of the pilot and the crew in the tank, where
their engine also was laboring with rattle of steel. The
tank bore on through the darkness and its mighty battering
ram hit the light engine fair and square and
knocked it off the rails. There were explanations and
apologies and much tugging and heaving with all the powers
of a tank before the engine was righted again and
went on its way. (Told in <i>New York Times</i>&mdash;Copyright,

<h3>III&mdash;STORY OF THE TANK THAT FOUGHT A
RAILROAD ENGINE</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Told to the Montreal (Canada) "Herald and Star"</i></div>

<p>"Hi, Bodger! Just keep clear of my weighing machine!
It's only up to a quarter of a ton, and I'm not
taking any risks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Temporary Captain Bodger, R.G.A., turned sadly
away from the Ration Depot and lumbered back to his
howitzers. He was an excellent officer, and his 8 in.
shells reached their address in Bocheland with the precision
of a postal delivery. But he weighed 280 pounds,
and his girth was threatening his career.</p>

<p>Only yesterday he had walked five miles to a field
artillery observing station in the trenches, whence he was
to range on a new German redoubt, and had ignominiously
failed to get through the tunnel. A party of grinning
Tommies had taken 40 minutes to enlarge the
entrance for him; the subaltern to whom the observation
post belonged had complained of his attracting the
attention of the enemy's airmen by waiting outside, and
the general, who unfortunately went by, had regarded
him with a send-him-to-the-base look in his eye. Something
must be done, but what?</p>

<p>Bodger had a light lunch of three chops and a plate of
ham, trifled with some suet pudding and cheese, and
ordered a second bottle of beer to assist his meditations.
But the only idea that emerged was a transfer to Coast
Defence, and this involved boat work, which his stomach
loathed. With a regretful glance at the empty bottles,
he went back to his work.</p>

<p>But in the meantime an intelligence of a higher order
had been shaping his destinies. The Army commander,
hearing the tale of the tunnel and the observation post,
had remarked: "Sound gunner, is he? No use sending
him to the Transport; lorries are overloaded already.
There's one thing in this Army that's up to his weight,
and that's a tank. Shift him over, will you?"</p>

<p>When the great man spoke things moved quickly, and
in the battery Bodger met an orderly with a "memo,"
directing him to report at once to H. M. landship <i>Mastodon</i>
for instruction. The <i>Mastodon</i> was a new ship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Her commander, a cavalry major, was pleased to get a
good gunnery man who was also useful as shifting ballast.
Bodger took kindly to his new duties, and the tank
steered sweetly under his sympathetic hand.</p>

<p>A week later the <i>Mastodon</i> took part in a minor push&mdash;a
little affair of straightening the line.</p>

<p>There was a parapet to get over, and the <i>Mastodon</i>,
according to custom, cocked up her tail and charged it.</p>

<p>Now if things had gone right the tail should have
come down with a whump, throwing her nose up, and
she should have cleared the bank like a porpoise jumping.
But the glue-like mud piled under her belly, her tail remained
up, her nose down, and she hit the face of the
bank with a bump like a luggage train in collision. She
backed out, but her tail remained high in air.</p>

<p>It was then that Bodger first distinguished himself.
He squeezed through a door. Heedless of the bullets
which hummed round him, he swarmed up the tail with
the determination of a bull walrus and sat on the end of
it. There was no mistake about the tail coming down
this time. The <i>Mastodon</i> charged again, nose well up,
and got over the bank, kicking up a shower of clods
behind her.</p>

<p>Bodger stuck to his perch, though the shell-splinters
whanged on the armour, and got off with nothing worse
than a chipped ear. After this he became a tank enthusiast,
and when his major was promoted Admiral of
the Fleet and hoisted his flag in the <i>Mammoth</i>, Bodger
succeeded to the command of the <i>Mastodon</i>. He painted
her in a beautiful chromatic color-scheme, and fitted a
larder and a cushioned beer-bin. He worked up his crew
at gunnery till they could hit a Boche parapet while
bumping across country. He enjoyed four solid meals a
day and ceased to repine at his increasing weight.</p>

<p>The Big Push came on, and Bodger's <i>Mastodon</i> proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the smartest landship in the fleet, while at gunnery she
could have given points to the <i>Excellent</i>. There came a
day when we had pierced deeply into the German lines,
and with it came Bodger's chance, which has made his
name in the Land Fleet. He saw a locomotive half a
mile in front dragging off a couple of howitzers along
a light railway, and, regardless of his admiral's warning
toots he made for it across the trenches.</p>

<p>Furious Germans tried to rush him as he ploughed
through their lines but he held the <i>Mastodon</i> to her
course, spouting flame on both broadsides. Field guns
were hurriedly turned on him, but the shells missed or
glanced from the armour. He headed off the locomotive
by a bare 50 fathoms, and, reversing his starboard chain,
jockeyed the <i>Mastodon</i> sharply round to meet it.</p>

<p>Now when a 60-ton locomotive hauling double its
weight of heavy howitzer, meets a 100-ton tank, both
all out, something is almost certain to happen. This
time it was the unexpected.</p>

<p>The antagonists stood on their tails, locked for a moment
like wrestlers, and then suddenly disappeared from
view. The railway crossed a hollow road at the point of
encounter and the bridge had given way. Down went
the locomotive, wheels uppermost, with the <i>Mastodon</i>
on top of it. The trucks with the monster howitzers
lumbered up and pitched on top of the heap. But the
tank, though dented like an old tin can, was little the
worse, and the Germans, who expected to find a wreck,
were met by shells and machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>There was no holding our men that day, and they
pressed on well beyond the hollow road where the <i>Mastodon</i>
had "brought up." When the leading battalion
reached her they found Bodger lunching on deck, with a
dozen bottles of beer standing ready for his visitors. He
was asked to describe his trip across the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
trenches, but preferred to expatiate on the perfections of
his cushioned beer-bin. "Only two bottles broken, and I
believe one of them had gone flat!"</p>

<p>A new 1,000-horsepower tank, carrying a 6 inch gun,
is ready for launching, and Bodger will command her.
He is looking forward to steering her through the streets
of Berlin.</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;STORY OF THE BATTLE MONSTERS AT
FALL OF THIEPVAL</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Told by Percival Phillips, with British Army in France</i></div>

<p>The capture of the greatest Prussian stronghold between
the Ancre and the Somme involved hard and bitter
fighting. Nowhere on the western front have the Prussian
troops made stronger resistance against odds or given
greater trouble in their underground lairs, dugouts and
tunnels. We know now that the Prussian lines yielded
many marvellous examples of catacomb work beneath the
hills and valleys of Northern France for the shelter of
their battalions. The British troops spoke to-day soberly
and impressively of scenes in the buried fortress that
lies below the blasted ridge.</p>

<p>Two "tanks" played an important part in the capture,
but the greatest "tank" story of the day concerns another
part of the line&mdash;the capture of Gueudecourt; and it is
so unusual and so thrilling as to give it precedence over
the exploits at Thiepval. This "tank" killed three hundred
Prussians who tried to storm it.</p>

<p>The "tank" had assisted in cleaning up Gueudecourt,
and infantry followed in its wake through the village,
cheering mightily. The shallow cellar shelters held about
four hundred prisoners, who gladly gave themselves up,
and the business at Gueudecourt was easily finished.</p>

<p>Then the "tank" started on a tour of its own in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
direction of a hostile trench beyond the town. Its progress
was a signal for other Prussian refugees lurking in
the shell craters to signal their submission to the advancing
monster.</p>

<p>Majestically the "tank" wallowed forward amid the
fluttering of white handkerchiefs that dotted the field
shell holes, and hastily scooped out one man from his
hiding place. These isolated ones would have been made
prisoners in the "tank," but it had neither time nor accommodation.
Bigger game lurked in the ground ahead.</p>

<p>It ambled on its lonely advance until a deep, broad
fissure in the tumbled earth made apparent the lodging
place for many armed men. The "tank's" intention was
to sit astride of this trench as a kind of deadly jest,
calculated to fill any troops with horror and play its machine
guns freely about, but suddenly it halted its engines
and stopped.</p>

<p>Instantly the Prussians swarmed out of the earth and
buzzed around the "tank" like bees. You must give them
credit for unusual courage, for although hidden batteries
rained bullets at them they made desperate attempts to
storm the travelling fort and to pierce its hide with rifle
fire and kill the crew within.</p>

<p>They might as well have attacked a battle ship with
spades. The machine guns whirled incessantly and the
pile of dead Prussians grew steadily around the monster,
but still there were rushes by these foolish men, who
clambered to the steel roof and hoisted one another up in
the hope of finding loopholes or joints in the armor of the
strange beast.</p>

<p>Some of them carried dead men on their shoulders
before they themselves were dropped by the hidden gunners.
It was a fearful and indescribable sight&mdash;this
futile combat of men with machinery. The "tank" fought
stolidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Inside, the crew were filled with joy. Never in their
wildest dreams had they conceived the possibility of having
Prussians crowding forward to be killed. Never did
gunners work their guns more heartily. All they asked
was for more Prussians.</p>

<p>The strange tumult drew the attention of the infantry
engaged in cleaning up odd corners throughout Gueudecourt.
They ran to the rescue of the "tank," but it did
not need rescuing. It was quite happy. The infantry
took a hand and beat the Prussians off, or, rather, what
was left of them. They took a few discouraged prisoners
from a field of battle thick with corpses. At least three
hundred Germans lay dead around that "tank."</p>

<h2>MY ESCAPE FROM THE TURKS
DISGUISED AS A WOMAN</h2>

<div class="center"><i>The Story of a Wonderful Feat</i><br /><br />
<i>Told by Private Miron D. Arber, Army Service Corps</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>Whilst living in Jaffa, Palestine, the author&mdash;a Russian subject&mdash;volunteered
to join the British Red Cross, but before he could
leave, Turkey declared war, and he was arrested and sent to a
prison camp in the interior. From this dreary place he made his
escape, and, cleverly disguised as a Bedouin woman, actually
crossed the terrible desert of Sinai, a distance of two hundred
miles, to the verge of the Suez Canal. On the banks of the
Canal, when within an ace of regaining his liberty, he was
seized by Turkish patrols and turned back into the desert. Sick
at heart, he retraced his steps, secured another female disguise,
and&mdash;let him tell his own story as he tells it in that thrilling
journal of adventure, the <i>Wide World Magazine</i>.</p></blockquote>


<h3>I&mdash;"I WAS A RUSSIAN MEDICAL STUDENT IN
PALESTINE"</h3>

<p>Before the war I was a Russian medical student. On
the outbreak of hostilities between England and Germany
I visited the British Consul at Jaffa, in Palestine, where
I was then residing, and after volunteering for service
with the British Red Cross obtained from him the necessary
documents to enable me to take up work with that
organization. I was most anxious to leave Palestine at
once, as I feared what the Turks might do; but to my
dismay I was held up by the Customs authorities, who
discovered the official British papers in my pockets.</p>

<p>Just two days afterwards Turkey declared war, and
the situation in Jaffa became horrible. The Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
confiscated all property belonging to the Allies that
they could lay hands upon, and its officials raided the
clothing establishments and commandeered the whole
stock of material. I even saw such articles as silks and
women's hosiery taken away by the Turkish officers&mdash;no
doubt intended for their wives. Proprietors of horse
vehicles were deprived of their sole means of livelihood
by the ruthless confiscation of their animals and carts,
and all mules or camels found in the streets were also
seized to carry ammunition and stores to the Egyptian
frontier. Such tradesmen as cabinet-makers and metal-workers
were forced to give their services for nothing,
and, failing prompt compliance, were thrown into prison,
there to remain under the most awful conditions. The
Turks made a thorough job of the looting; people in the
streets were forcibly relieved of any wearing apparel
that had the slightest military use, and their leggings,
raincoats, and similar articles were annexed by the Turkish
officers. Houses were entered and robbed of bedding,
mattresses, and pillows for the benefit of Turkish
wounded, and private dwellings and public institutions
alike&mdash;for example, the Anglo-Palestine Bank&mdash;were systematically
searched and valuables, money, and banknotes
confiscated. The Turk is a past-master in the art
of looting.</p>

<p>Two days after the declaration of war orders were
received from Constantinople for the expulsion from
Turkish territory of all subjects of the Allies. Men,
women, and children were accosted in the streets, and
proof of their nationality demanded. If belonging to
one of the Allied nations they were herded together and
conveyed during the night from Jaffa to Egypt in an
Italian steamer. The sights witnessed were most distressing,
parents being separated from their children
and husbands from their wives. A number of small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
boats arrived during the night to take the people out to
the ship, it being impossible to bring a large vessel close
in. After the unfortunate refugees had been put in the
boats they were taken by the Arab boatmen about half-way
to the ship. Here the rowers rested on their oars
and demanded large sums of money before completing
the journey. In many cases the poor folk were unable
to pay.</p>


<h3>II&mdash;"I SAW ARABS AND TURKS ILL-TREAT THE
NUNS"</h3>

<p>In a certain hospital at Jaffa&mdash;this I know personally
to be true&mdash;the French nuns there, who had with unceasing
care and attention devoted themselves to sick and
needy Arabs and Turks, were now rewarded for their
past unselfish labors by the grossest ill-treatment, being
driven out without any thought as to what was to become
of them. One incident in particular well depicts the
atrocious treatment meted out to these devoted women
by the Turks. An old man who had been at this hospital
for twenty years told me that when German and Turkish
commandants visited the place they asked the French
orderly why the sick Turkish troops had no food to
eat, to which he replied that there was no money with
which to obtain it. Thereupon these heartless officials
ordered the Frenchman to be seized and soundly flogged.</p>

<p>From now onward the position for subjects of the
Allies became worse and worse. Directly hostilities began,
gendarmes came to our house and took me away
in the presence of my mother and sister. It was a terrible
parting, as may be easily imagined. The distress
of the two women was most pitiful, and I dreaded to think
what their fate might be when left unprotected. Because
of the natural outburst of anger and sorrow on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
their part, they were the recipients of further mental
punishment at the hands of my captors, one of whom
threatened my mother with his rifle in order to increase
her terror, while another roughly pushed her aside whilst
I was hustled from the scene. In my anguish I struck
one of them, but they soon overpowered me and dragged
me off.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of my sufferings. When I
arrived at the Government buildings with my escort I
was told that I was a prisoner of war and was about
to be sent away. I was, however, allowed to bid good-bye
to my mother and sister, who had followed me there.
Afterwards I was carefully searched, permission being
refused me to take away any luggage whatever. From
early in the morning until ten o'clock at night I was
guarded in these buildings; then, a number of other prisoners
of war having arrived, we were all taken outside
and placed upon donkeys. An escort surrounded us,
and we set off inland. We marched away along a route
which, fortunately, was already well known to me, for
as a tourist in the happy days of peace I had traversed
it many times previously.</p>

<p>At three o'clock the next morning we arrived at an
Arab village, where we rested until nine o'clock, when
breakfast was served. This consisted of Arab bread&mdash;prepared
in a couple of minutes from water, flour, and
salt&mdash;and a small piece of cheese. The inhabitants of
this village pelted us with stones and subjected us to
most insulting and abusive language.</p>


<h3>III&mdash;"I WAS TAKEN PRISONER TO AN ARAB
HUT AT BEERSHEBA"</h3>

<p>After breakfast our journey was continued until the
afternoon, when we halted until eight o'clock. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
we started off again, reaching a place called Ber Sheba,
or Beersheba, about sixty miles from Jaffa, by the following
morning. Here we were all separated, and I
was taken to an Arab hut and given a straw mattress to
lie on and a filthy blanket to cover me. The same meagre
fare&mdash;native bread and a small piece of cheese&mdash;was again
served out to me, and I was left alone. After spending
two days and nights in this wretched shelter I was removed
to another, which I fully made up my mind was
to be the last ere I attempted my escape, which I was
continually thinking about.</p>

<p>The stretch of ground allotted to the prisoners-of-war
camps was surrounded by a barbed-wire fence some
twelve feet high, having only one gateway. The camp
consisted of about twenty-five huts, the bulk of these
being for the accommodation of the prisoners, and the
remainder for the soldiers. Posted to every four of
these buildings was a guard consisting of several sentries,
stationed at a distance of from twenty to thirty
yards from the buildings. Every Friday it was the custom
for the soldiers&mdash;who were, of course, Mohammedans&mdash;to
attend the mosque, and on these occasions
but few sentries were left to guard the camp; the gate
was also allowed to stand open. I therefore decided
that, when I had worked out a plan of escape, I would
choose a Friday on which to attempt it.</p>

<p>In the camp I had the good fortune to come in contact
with other prisoners of war, who generously gave
me some of their money, of which I stood in great need,
for I knew that money would be absolutely necessary to
aid my escape. After a short time, having received
various small amounts in this way, I accumulated quite
a useful sum.</p>

<p>Although the food was wretched and the accommodation
miserable, I must state in fairness that I received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
much kindness from different Turkish officers, who,
perceiving that I was sad and anxious, had compassion
on me and tried to console me. When the German officers,
however, with their renowned <i>kultur</i>, came to know
this, they became enraged, and forbade the officers to
have anything to do with me. There was much bad
feeling, by the way, between the Turks and the Germans,
because while the latter enjoyed plenty of luxuries, the
former entirely lacked them, and received pay which
was totally inadequate to their needs.</p>

<p>About this time many wounded soldiers began to arrive
at Ber Sheba from the Egyptian frontier, where,
it was very evident, there was "something doing." They
were conveyed to our camp in large baskets&mdash;each
capable of holding ten wounded&mdash;slung upon the backs
of camels. On arrival at the village, half of the unfortunate
occupants were usually dead or dying as the result
of the shaking and jostling occasioned by this crude
method of transport. As it became known that I was a
medical student, my services were utilized, and I attended
to the wounded in the hospital. One might have thought
this would have secured me better treatment, but as a
matter of fact I was brutally ill-used, somebody whom
I had offended reporting to the officer commanding that
I knocked the wounded about! This ended my hospital
career, and I was at once placed under arrest and confined
to my hut again. The food provided now consisted
of rice, meat, and bread, all served together in a
bowl. This latter turned out to be the bowl of fortune
for me, for it occurred to me that it would make an
excellent improvised implement for removing the earth
beneath the wall of my hut, thus providing me with a
means of exit when the time came for my "flitting."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV&mdash;"MY PLAN TO FLEE OVER SINAI DESERT
TO SUEZ CANAL"</h3>

<p>Night and day I brooded over the problem of escape.
My original idea was to elude the vigilance of the guards
and get out of the camp through its solitary gate, open
on Fridays only. Once outside, I intended to proceed
to Jaffa, and somehow get on board a ship there. This
plan, however, I had to abandon, for a newly-arrived
prisoner of whom I made inquiries informed me that
there was no boat available at that port. I had, therefore,
no alternative but to choose the crossing of the
terrible Sinai Desert to the Suez Canal, a distance of
approximately two hundred miles. This was a sufficiently
formidable undertaking, but even though I risked
dying of exhaustion or thirst on the way I determined
to try it, if I got the chance, sooner than endure the
misery of my life in the camp. By journeying that way
I thought I might be able to give the British authorities
in Egypt useful information concerning the Turks.</p>

<p>It was obvious to me, of course, that I could not hope
to cross the desert, through a region that was full of
Turkish soldiers, in my own character&mdash;such an enterprise
would have been sheer madness. I decided, after
much consideration, that my best plan would be to disguise
myself as a Bedouin woman.</p>

<p>Let me explain exactly why I chose to take on a female
<i>rôle</i>&mdash;a very difficult one for most men to sustain.
Before the war I had impersonated women on many
occasions, both on the theatrical stage and on concert
platforms in Russia and Turkey&mdash;where I appeared under
the name of "Valia Pavlov"&mdash;in aid of charity. For
example, although I had only seen her twice in France,
I quite satisfactorily impersonated Mme. Sarah Bernhardt.
I can successfully imitate a woman in walking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
speaking, and singing, my face, figure and soprano voice
lending themselves admirably for these purposes. I
knew, moreover, that a woman would be less suspected
than a man, would not be closely questioned, and would
have more freedom. In other words, there would be
less chance of detection.</p>

<p>Now it is easy enough for a prisoner to decide that
he will escape disguised as a woman; the difficulty is to
put the plan into execution. But I knew what I was
about, and I thought I saw my road to success, though
it was one that needed careful negotiation. Every day I
was allowed a few hours for exercise outside the camp,
escorted, of course, by my own particular guard. Having
a good knowledge of Arabic, I had the opportunity,
while stretching my legs in this way, of conversing with
the Bedouins who dwelt in the neighborhood. The soldier
who accompanied me was, fortunately for me, quite
ignorant of the language of these people. This was a
real stroke of good fortune, and materially helped me in
laying my plans. If I was to cross the desert in the
guise of a Bedouin woman I should need the assistance
of these folk, and I neglected no opportunity of making
good friends of them. To this end I gave them small
sums of money from time to time, taking care not to
reveal to them in any way my intentions, for my knowledge
of their character led me to believe that, should I
require any favor of them later on, they would not
refuse it to me, and so it turned out.</p>

<p>After a lot of preparatory work of this kind&mdash;most
of it done under the very nose of my unsuspecting guard&mdash;I
finally selected the man I thought could be relied
upon to help me. He never for a moment suspected my
intention to escape, as I carefully explained to him that
I wanted to obtain an outfit of female attire to enable
me to make a journey to see a friend of mine who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
a prisoner of war near the Suez Canal. He swallowed
my story in its entirety, and in his guileless simplicity
was convinced that I should return after accomplishing
my errand. He arranged to supply me, when I notified
him that I was ready, with a complete outfit "borrowed"
from his wife, and to set me on my way to Suez.</p>

<p>It was now "up to me" to devise a means of getting
out of my hut and clear of the camp. I have already
mentioned my possession of a bowl, with which I intended
to dig a tunnel under the side of my hut. Let
me now describe the hut itself, in order that my position
may be quite clear.</p>

<p>My prison was constructed of wood and canvas, the
form of the interior being to all intents and purposes
that of a bell-tent. The skin was of canvas, lined with
wood clamped together with stout iron strips. There
was a door to the hut, with a strong lock, in which the
key was turned upon me after every visit from my guard&mdash;twice
to three times daily. Directly I had fixed things
up with the Bedouin I started digging my tunnel. Sometimes
the sentry disturbed me during my excavations,
but as I was always on the alert, his approach, followed
by the click of the key in the lock, gave me sufficient
warning to fling my mattress quickly over the hole, take
my seat on a box, and look up calmly when he entered,
thus avoiding rousing his suspicions. There was little
danger to be apprehended from the outside, owing to
the great height of the grass and weeds which grew all
around the hut. Scraping laboriously with my precious
bowl, distributing the scooped-up material carefully over
the earthern floor of the hut so as not to attract attention,
and on the <i>qui vive</i> night and day, I worked at my
burrow for three whole days. The tension I underwent
during this period, and the constant anxiety that tortured
me, are quite indescribable. I worked like a fiend;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
I had fully determined that I would not remain in the
camp any longer even though death waited for me
outside.</p>


<h3>V&mdash;"I MAKE MY ESCAPE DISGUISED AS A
BEDOUIN WOMAN"</h3>

<p>My tunnel being completed, I fixed the hour of departure
with my Bedouin friend, arranging for him to be
waiting at a specified spot about two hundred yards
away. The time appointed was in the dead of night&mdash;at
12.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, to be exact&mdash;and as the hour approached
I worked myself into a feverish state of excitement. I
became terribly nervous, thinking of the risk I was about
to take and the journey that awaited me if I got free.
I realized, almost for the first time, the manifold difficulties
of my enterprise, and I told myself I was only
going to my doom. Then, as the hands of my watch
moved steadily onward, the reaction came, and I grew
calm and confident. Courage was needed to make this
dash for freedom&mdash;well, I would show courage. The
moment for action came, and swiftly I removed the
mattress that had hitherto concealed my secret passage,
put my head through the aperture, and peeped out to
survey my surroundings.</p>

<p>So terrible was the tension at that moment that the
very grasses which waved in the faint night breeze and
the leaves that rustled in the trees caused me to start
as though my plans had been discovered; I saw myself,
in my mind's eye, thrown back into my cage and subjected
to all the humiliating punishments and sufferings
that would inevitably have followed. So much was I
overcome by my feelings at this moment that I wept
for very fear, and, kneeling down, prayed fervently to
my Maker to give me back the courage which I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
was leaving me and restore the strength of mind and
body that alone could see me safely through that never-to-be-forgotten
ordeal.</p>

<p>When the nerve-storm passed I quietly emerged from
my hiding place and crept silently away through the
grass, making for the point where I was to meet my
Bedouin Good Samaritan. I passed through the open
gateway in the fence without accident, and arrived at
the rendezvous quite breathless. Thank Heaven! My
friend was there, and to my surprise and joy he had secured
for me a camel, upon which I was to continue my
flight.</p>

<p>My joy at this first success is indescribable. There
was no time to be lost, however, so I speedily divested
myself of my prison attire, which, upon the advice of
my Bedouin friend, I carefully buried. I then dressed
myself with all possible haste in the disguise my friend
had procured for me.</p>

<p>This consisted of a Bedouin dress of some blue-colored
stuff with white spots, and resembled an overall
or woman's nightgown, secured around the waist with
a red sash. The head-dress was a small loose-fitting
green bonnet, which had stitched to it a cheap black
cotton substitute for woman's hair. Suspended from my
ears were large brown polished wooden earrings and droppers,
and over all I threw loosely a large piece of thin
black veiling, resembling a shawl, which covered the
whole of my head, face, and figure, leaving only my eyes
showing. My feet were left quite bare. No facial
make-up was necessary, my skin being smooth and quite
as brown as any Bedouin's. Being thoroughly familiar,
from my various impersonations, with the adjustment
of a woman's dress, I was able without difficulty to put
this costume on in the dark, and I was greatly helped
by the fact that before the war my parents had employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
a Bedouin servant whose dresses I had worn on the
occasion of various carnivals.</p>

<p>The problem of shaving had already occurred to me,
and fortunately for my purpose, a very simple solution
was available. I obtained some powder which, after
being mixed with water and applied to the face, completely
destroys the hair for the time being. This depilatory
is in common use amongst the Bedouins, Arabs, and
Turks for the removal of hair, whether from the body
or face. My toilet being completed, I rose to my feet&mdash;looking
to all appearance a typical Bedouin woman&mdash;and
the pair of us mounted the camel and rode steadily
on for fifteen hours to a place called Wad-el-Arish. Our
rations during that long, weary journey consisted of
onions, bread, and a few dates.</p>

<p>Upon arrival at Wad-el-Arish my good friend and I
parted company, for he feared to accompany me farther
lest he should run into danger, as there would be great
risk for him in passing that way by reason of the troops
journeying in the same direction. I used all my powers
of persuasion to induce him to continue with me, assuring
him optimistically that no harm would come to him,
but despite all my efforts to allay his fears, he declined.
Ere we parted, he bestowed on me such good things as
he was able to spare for my comfort and sustenance
during my travels, giving me a flask of water, dry bread,
and dates. Then, after a hearty farewell, he retraced
his steps, riding the camel, while I continued alone on
foot, following the track left by the troops who were
journeying across the desert.</p>


<h3>VI&mdash;"I MEET A PACK OF HUNGRY JACKALS IN
THE DESERT"</h3>

<p>My first day in the desert was a hot and tiring one,
but in spite of the discomfort I continued to walk on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
until the evening, never losing sight of the soldiers and
camels far ahead. When darkness fell I settled down
on the sand for the night with only a dirty blanket for
my covering, the desert for my bed, and the heavens to
shelter me.</p>

<p>With the coming of dawn I was on my way again.
The second and third days, being uneventful, call for no
description; but I recollect that, on the fourth day, I was
accosted by several Turkish patrols, who endeavored to
question me. A happy thought struck me, and I kept
silent, simply motioning to them with my fingers, giving
them the impression that I was deaf and dumb, and
therefore an object of pity. I knew only too well the
nature of these Mohammedans&mdash;fanatical in the extreme,
pitying only the afflicted and maimed of their own caste.
Had I been a <i>real</i> woman, I should have been terribly
afraid of some of these ruffianly fellows, but as it was I
feared nothing but discovery, and my pretence of being
deaf and dumb gave me excellent protection.</p>

<p>When one or two of them seemed inclined to interfere
with me, their comrades, pitying me, shouted angrily:
"Haram, haram! For the love of God, don't touch her."
With that they left me, and very thankfully I went on
my way.</p>

<p>By the fifth day my slender stock of provisions was
running low, only a few dates and a little bread remaining,
but my good luck seemed destined to continue, for
I met with hospitality from some of the soldiers I encountered,
who gave me bread, dates, and water. About
two o'clock in the afternoon of the sixth day a terrible
wind arose, and the sandstorm which followed nearly
blinded and choked me. I could do nothing but crouch
down and cover myself with my blanket as best I could,
remaining in that position until ten o'clock at night, when
the wind ceased. I continued my journey during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
night so as to make up for lost time, and to my horror
was met by a pack of prowling jackals. These beasts,
when hungry, are dangerous to the solitary traveller,
and my alarm can well be imagined; but curiously enough
the fear was reciprocal, and the skulking brutes disappeared.</p>

<p>On the seventh day of my interminable journey I met
an old Bedouin riding on a camel, and was not long in
fraternizing with him. After paying him the customary
compliments&mdash;not forgetting a little money, that magic
key to the Bedouin heart&mdash;I travelled with him for five
days, the pair of us riding together on his camel. This
event, I think, appealed to my sense of humor more than
any other incident of my escape. For five whole days
and nights we were in each other's company&mdash;yet the
simple old fellow never discovered or even suspected
my secret. To him I was just simply a woman of his
own race. He treated me with respect, and, in his Bedouin
way, even showed me kindness. I laugh now
when I think about it, and how startled he would have
been to learn the truth. He left me at the end of the
fifth day, at a point where our routes diverged, and
once more I went on alone on foot.</p>

<p>On the twelfth day of my journey across the desert,
what with the hardship and the poor food, I began to get
exhausted. I felt feverish and deadly tired, but realized
that I must not give way, and, remembering how fortune
had favored me hitherto, I determined to press forward
and reach the Canal as speedily as possible. I was plodding
doggedly on, a few hours later, when I sighted a
party of mounted gendarmes approaching, and the
thought instantly flashed through my mind that I was
being chased; they would take me prisoner again, and
drag me back to be punished. The idea filled me with
terror, but I managed to evade them by concealing myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
behind a hillock of sand, where from sheer exhaustion
and nerve-strain I fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>The thirteenth morning of my trip had dawned when
I awoke, and I knew that the journey was nearing its
end. This was well for me, for I was beginning to
run short of food again, having only a little bread and
a few dates left, so I ate sparingly lest my stock should
become exhausted ere I reached my next resting-place.</p>

<p>Towards the close of my wanderings that day luck
again befriended me, for I chanced to meet a party of
Bedouins encamped in the desert, and they provided me
with the now familiar fare of onions, salt, water, and
bread. Like the Turks, they had not the slightest suspicion
that I was other than I seemed.</p>

<p>From these people I learned definitely that my journey
was nearing completion; only one and half day's
travel was needed, and it would be ended. My anxiety
seemed to increase during these last hours of my pilgrimage,
and many a time I almost succumbed from
weakness, but I forced myself to continue.</p>

<p>At last, to my joy, I perceived signs of some sort of
civilization in the distance&mdash;tents, soldiers, and all the
miscellaneous equipment of a Turkish army and its innumerable
camp-followers. I trudged on and on through
this concourse, quite unchallenged&mdash;who would bother
about a poor deaf-mute Bedouin woman?&mdash;and eventually
arrived near the Canal. How excited I was at
sight of it! How I longed to be on the other side! On
the opposite shore I could see soldiers, but I was too
far away to distinguish what troops they were.</p>


<h3>VII&mdash;"TURKISH HORSEMEN FORCE ME BACK
ACROSS THE DESERT"</h3>

<p>On approaching nearer to the Canal I came to a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
opposite El Kantara, where some English soldiers on the
farther bank pointed their rifles at me and forced me to
stop. Away behind me, at the top of a slope, were some
Turkish patrols on horseback, and to my dismay I saw
that they were watching me closely. I had hoped to get
near enough to the British to open up communication with
them, but this now seemed out of the question; directly
I made a move in that direction the horsemen would
swoop down upon me.</p>

<p>Evidently I should have to wait for a better chance,
so with a sinking heart I walked towards the Turks,
thinking that by adopting an indifferent attitude I could
dispel any suspicions I might have aroused. I sat down
as they approached me, and when questioned by them
explained that I was a Bedouin woman going to Egypt.
(I thought it advisable on this occasion not to keep up
my pretence of being deaf and dumb.) They told me
roughly that this was impossible; there was a war on,
and Egypt was closed to strangers.</p>

<p>Then came the bombshell; they ordered me to return
whence I came, and, to make my departure certain, conducted
me away from the camps and told me not to let
them see me wandering about again.</p>

<p>I do not like to dwell upon my feelings at that awful
moment. Here had I risked my life to escape, and spent
many weary, anxious days in crossing the desert, only to
be turned back when actually in sight of my goal, and
almost within hail of British soldiers! It was heart-breaking,
maddening. I could hardly control myself as
I went slowly back into the desert, and I dared not think
of what lay in store for me. I might perish miserably
in the sand-wastes, or I might stagger on till I fell once
more into the hands of my late keepers, who would punish
me savagely for my abortive escape.</p>

<p>There is a bright lining to the darkest cloud, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and so I discovered. I had not proceeded very far on
my return journey when I came across a party of Bedouins
who, as luck would have it, were travelling in the
same direction. I promptly made friends with them, and
for a small sum of money they allowed me to ride on
camel-back with their wives, the journey to Ber Sheba
taking about six days. Never once did any of them suspect
me. Undoubtedly my disguise was well-nigh perfect,
but it must also be remembered that the Bedouins are
a simple people, and the reverse of cultured, so that my
task was tolerably easy.</p>

<p>Arrived at Ber Sheba once again, I bade good-bye to
my new friends and sought out my old Bedouin acquaintance
at the place where he lived. He was amazed to
see me back so soon, and told me that the Turkish authorities
had been greatly perturbed over my escape, and
were still searching for me. It would be unsafe to remain,
he told me, so I only stopped with him a very
short time.</p>

<p>It was obvious to me that it would be of no use to try
the desert route again, so I evolved a new plan. Leaving
Ber Sheba, I made for a place called Gaza, some thirty
miles away, proceeding immediately after to Jaffa, where
I managed to exchange my Bedouin dress for that of a
European lady. I should here explain that I have found
it necessary at several points in my story not to go
into details, and I must also suppress the names of the
kind friends who provided me with the disguise. Sundry
good people who helped me are still in Palestine, and
it might go hard with them if I gave any clue to their
identity.</p>


<h3>VIII&mdash;THE RESCUE&mdash;ON AN ITALIAN STEAMER
TO EGYPT</h3>

<p>When I reached Jaffa the Italian steamer <i>Catania</i> had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
just arrived at the port, and I promptly embarked upon
her, despite the strict scrutiny of a German female Customs
official. She looked over all the women who boarded
the steamer, but she never dreamed for one moment
that I was a disguised man, and I passed on to the boat
without question.</p>

<p>On the voyage I made friends with a lady refugee,
and, finding that she was to be trusted, confided my
secret to her. This good woman helped me out of my
last difficulty by lending me a suit belonging to her husband,
to don directly I landed in Egypt. Oh! the delight
of once more resuming a man's attire and a man's ways
of life!</p>

<p>Arrived in Egypt, and once more in my own proper
person, I visited the British military authorities at Alexandria,
who referred me to No. 5 Indian General Hospital
at St. Stephano. Here, being a medical student, I
secured employment and remained for some time doing
Red Cross work under Colonel Pridmore, the officer
commanding that institution, to whom, and to Mrs. Pridmore,
I am much indebted for many kindnesses. Later
I went to No. 2 Australian General Hospital at Cairo.
Subsequently I was transferred, at my own request, to
London, where I enlisted in the Army Service Corps and
became a British soldier. Since then I have had the
pleasure of appearing before many thousands of my
soldier comrades as a female impersonator, amusing them
with my songs and the story of my adventures.</p>

<p>It is one thing to act the part of a woman for the sake
of amusement; it is quite another to do it in an attempt
to secure one's liberty, with death as the price of discovery.</p>

<h2>TALES OF GERMAN AIR RAIDERS
OVER LONDON AND PARIS</h2>

<div class="center">"<i>How We Drop Bombs on the Enemies' Cities</i>"<br /><br />
<i>Told by the Air Raiders Themselves</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>The first stirring sensations of the Great War, which aroused
the imaginations of the people, were the sailing of the fleets of
ships in the air and under the seas. The world was indeed
startled when the squadrons of Zeppelins rose from Germany,
crossed the seas, and hovered over England, dropping bombs
on ports and cities, and hurling death from the clouds. Here
are two stories of German raiders in which they tell how it feels
to drop bombs from the skies on European capitals. The German
authorities permitted the publication in a Hamburg newspaper
of a very exciting and detailed account of a Zeppelin raid
upon London by one of the crew of the airship. This account
was designed to arouse the enthusiasm of the German nation for
the daring and difficult work done by the Zeppelins, and to make
them realize the havoc and terror they created in England. A
translation of the narrative follows:</p></blockquote>


<h3>I&mdash;"HOW WE ZEPPELINED THE HEART OF
LONDON"</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Told by Commander of a German Air Fleet</i></div>

<p>Our Zeppelin received orders at 6 o'clock in the evening
to fly from our hangar in Belgium for an attack on
London.</p>

<p>The giant airship slipped easily out of the long shed
with noiseless motors, and after rising to 8,000 feet, the
altitude most suited for steady flying, our captain steered
by compass straight for London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Our true German hearts beat high this night with the
hope of doing some great and irreparable damage to
London....</p>

<p>Perhaps we should destroy their House of Parliament
... or their War Office ... or the Foreign Office ...
or the official dwellings of the Prime Minister and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer.... Well did I know the
location of all these places from my long residence in
London.</p>

<p>Our commander said that a bomb dropped in a certain
space of half a square mile in London could hardly fail
to destroy some person of great importance in the official
or wealthy classes of England.</p>

<p>Perhaps we might strike a school or a hospital or a
party of women. We should regret such accidents, but
it is impossible to modify our splendid and effective
aerial warfare simply because innocent combatants place
themselves in the way of legitimate objects of attack....
We know that London is a fortified city, and non-combatants
who remain there do so at their own peril.</p>

<p>The way had for months been prepared by previous
aerial attacks and reconnoissances for a more accurate
and effective blow at the heart of London. All lights,
both street lamps and those in dwellings, have been lowered
by order of the English Government to a point that
causes the busiest thoroughfare at night to present only a
dull glow a few hundred yards away.</p>

<p>On the other hand, powerful searchlights operated in
connection with anti-aircraft guns, and other military
works are kept constantly playing on the sky in the search
for our airships. If we can discover the topographical
position of these searchlights and batteries we can establish
the other principal centres of the city from them and
throw our bombs with some approach to accuracy&mdash;that
is to say, we can at least drop them on a quarter where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
we know that there are public buildings or where important
officials reside.</p>

<p>To establish the location of these points has been the
work of our earlier air reconnoissances, and as a result
of this system our work must become more and more
deadly every day. We have, for instance, found that
powerful searchlights and batteries are operated at Woolwich
on the extreme eastern outskirts of London, at St.
James's Park, which is in the centre of the metropolis, at
Hampstead Heath on the north, and at the Crystal
Palace, south of the Thames. The English are not likely
to move all these defensive points, and if one is moved
and not the others, the captain of the Zeppelin can discover
the change by reference to the other points.</p>

<p>As our Zeppelin can travel seventy miles an hour at
its maximum, the journey of a little more than two hundred
miles from Belgium could be performed in a few
hours. Darkness was falling as we passed over the
stormy North Sea for we did not wish to be seen and
reported by patrol ships.</p>

<p>The cold was intense and could be felt through the
fleece-lined clothes and heavy felt shoes with which we
were provided. Our Zeppelin carried four tons of the
most destructive explosives ever created by science&mdash;sufficient
to annihilate the heart of London, the greatest
city in the world. The amount was divided into forty
bombs of 100 pounds each, and eighty of fifty pounds
each. The larger bombs are designed to destroy fortifications
and heavy buildings. The smaller ones are for the
purpose of setting fire to houses, and contain an explosive
that develops a temperature of 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>We made out the mouth of the Thames from certain
lightships and shore lights that have been maintained. At
about 10 o'clock we found a powerful searchlight playing
on us. This we knew from our information to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Woolwich, the important English arsenal. As we no
longer desired to conceal our presence, we discharged ten
of the larger bombs in the vicinity of the searchlight.</p>

<p>The bombs are discharged from tubes pointing downward
from a steel plate in the floor of the airship. The
bomb is furnished with a steel handle, and by means of
this it is lowered into the tube. A bolt fitting into a hole
in the bomb holds it in the tube. The marksman presses
his foot on an electric button in the plate in the floor of
the car and this withdraws the bolt, releasing the bombs.
He can drop two bombs at once if he wishes, and the
third two seconds later.</p>

<p>The height at which the airship flies, its speed and the
effects of wind at present render impossible scientific aim
in the sense that an artillerist would use the term. Nevertheless
a considerable degree of effectiveness is attained
by Zeppelin marksmen, while a poor marksman may
entirely waste his ammunition. To hit a mark half an
acre in extent is good marksmanship from a Zeppelin.
In practice a regiment of wooden dummies was set up
in a field and one of our aerial marksmen succeeded in
wiping out the whole regiment.</p>

<p>If Zeppelin marksmanship is still rudimentary, the
destructive power of our bombs, on the other hand, is terrible
beyond anything dreamed of before this war. One
of our 100-pound bombs striking fairly will destroy any
existing building not constructed purely as a fortification.
Even if it strikes in a street, it will dig a hole a hundred
feet deep, destroying gas pipes, electric wire conduits,
subways and any subterranean constructions that may be
beneath the surface. Thus the destruction and paralyzing
of all life in a city can be practically assured if we
use sufficient bombs. Our bombardment of Woolwich
was followed by the extinction of the searchlight, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
we had reason to believe that we had inflicted serious
damage at this important centre.</p>

<p>We knew that in a few minutes we should be over
the heart of London. Our daring commander decided to
sail very low, following the course of the Thames which
he knew would take him near all the objects he wished to
reach.</p>

<p>Suddenly the huge outline of a building loomed under
our noses. Seen against the dull, cloudy sky, it appeared
colossal. We almost struck it. It was a church! It
was St. Paul's Cathedral! An instantaneous turn of the
elevating rudder saved us from a collision with the monstrous
dome. A few seconds more straight to the westward
and we knew that we were over the centre of
official and fashionable London.</p>

<p>Our commander ordered the bombs discharged as fast
as we could throw them. The ship circled slowly round
and round, peppering death on the solar plexus of the
British Empire.</p>

<p>Beneath us was the Strand, with its theatres and hotels,
the House of Parliament, the Government offices in
Whitehall and Parliament street, the residences of the
aristocracy in Mayfair, the fashionable clubs in Pall Mall,
Buckingham Palace, the War Office, the Admiralty and
Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>It was a night of terror for London! The searchlights
and the guns played upon us constantly. At night the
anti-aircraft fighters use shells that spread a long trail of
luminous red smoke through the darkness in order to
mark the position of the airship for the other gunners
firing shrapnel. It was a grand and inconceivably weird
spectacle to watch the electric beams and the long red
trails playing about in the air, while shrapnel burst about
us and our great bombs exploded on the earth below
with a glow that we could faintly discern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>It is exceedingly difficult for a gunner to hit an airship
at a height of 8,000 feet, or even lower. We enjoyed a
feeling of tremendous power and security. Our daring
commander ordered our craft to circle lower and lower
in his determination to inflict the greatest possible injury
on the enemy.</p>

<p>At last we could see the outlines of buildings on the
ground. Below us was a great open square and in the
centre a very high slender column. It was the ...
British monument to their noted Admiral Nelson standing
in the centre of Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p>"Give old Nelson a bomb!" roared our brave commander.</p>

<p>Down went a bomb aimed straight at the head of the
one-eyed admiral. The fervent wishes of every man in
our crew went with it. Whether it struck the mark time
alone will show.</p>

<p>We had ventured too near the earth, and an unusually
well-aimed shot struck the forward part of our vessel.
One of our mechanical experts, in his anxiety to ascertain
the nature of the damage, climbed out on a stay, fell
and was, of course, lost. That was our only casualty.
We found later that the shot had only penetrated one
"ballonnet" and had not interfered with our stability in
any important degree.</p>

<p>Our commander threw the elevating rudders to their
extreme upward angle, and in a few minutes we were
practically out of danger once more. We threw all our
supply of bombs upon London and then turned for home
again. Steering by compass and the stars for Belgium,
we made the return journey without mishap. The dawn
was just breaking when we came in sight of certain
landmarks which guided us to our hangar.</p>

<p>There are certain details of the raid which I should not
wish to reveal, and could not reveal without making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
myself liable to the death penalty. An attack by a Zeppelin
is always accompanied by other air craft, both
dirigibles and aeroplanes, in order to give protection to
our capital airships and create confusion among the
enemy. The English never know whether they are firing
at a Zeppelin or a semi-rigid dirigible of similar shape,
but comparatively small importance. These are the scouting
cruisers of the air. Moreover our raiding forces
split up in the darkness according to prearranged plans,
thus causing hopeless confusion among our terrestrial
opponents, even if the approaching attack has been reported
to them in advance.</p>


<h3>II&mdash;HOW IT FEELS TO DROP BOMBS ON PARIS</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Told by a Young German Aeronaut in a Letter to His
Mother</i></div>

<p>
Dear Mother:<br />
</p>

<p>Thank God! After a veritable Odyssey, to-day at noon
I again reached my division. With much joy I was
greeted on all sides, for, after a four days' absence I
was given up for lost. Dear little mother, I shall tell
you the story from the beginning. During the forenoon
I went up at D&mdash;&mdash; for the purpose of ascertaining the
enemy's position at L&mdash;&mdash; and F&mdash;&mdash;, and to take notes
on their movements. Ober-Lieutenant K&mdash;&mdash; went along
as observer, and my biplane soon carried us to a height
of about 800 metres above the enemy's position, which
was sketched and photographed time and again. As expected,
we were soon the object of a lively firing, and
several times I felt a well-known trembling in the machine&mdash;a
sign that a shot had hit one of the wings. After
a three-hour flight we were able to give our reports to
General Herringen at headquarters. He praised us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
warmly and ordered that we be served a roast chicken
and he gave us some fine Havana cigars.</p>

<p>As I was again preparing my aeroplane in the afternoon,
with the help of several chauffeurs, who filled the
benzine tank, and as I was patching the four bullet holes
with linen, a Bavarian officer told me that he would like
to observe the retreat of the English from the large pike
toward M&mdash;&mdash;. I prepared my machine immediately, and
around 4 o'clock, with Major G&mdash;&mdash;, I went up. By
following the streets it was soon evident that the English
retreat was without plan or order, but to all appearances
the troops wanted to reach fortified positions as fast as
they could. Perhaps they would flee all the way to Paris.</p>

<p>Paris! The Bavarian officer shrieking something to
me. Though the motor almost drowned, I understood
what he meant. I glanced at the benzine indicator. I
possessed sufficient oil. Paris it would be!</p>

<p>Steering toward the south, we journeyed for half an
hour, and then out of the distance, far, far below, the
gray stone housetops of the French capital took shape.
Something impelled me to increase our speed, and we
raced toward the city at seventy miles an hour. Incredibly
fast Paris becomes clearer and more distinct.</p>

<p>The chain of the forts St. Denis! Montmartre stands
out through the mist! The iron pillars of the Eifel
Tower!... We are directly above Paris. The major
points below with his finger; then he slowly turns to me,
raises himself from his seat and shouts, "Hurrah!"</p>

<p>And I? From sheer joy, mother, I nearly went out of
my mind. I began to make the wildest circles in the
air. I felt I could do anything. There the white Sacred
Heart Church, here the Gare du Nord, there Notre Dame,
there the old "Boul Mich," where as a student I had so
often caroused and which now, as conqueror, I soared
above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>The heart of the enemy seemed defenseless; the proud,
gleaming Seine lay below me. Everything horrible which
I always thought of Paris as possessing vanished&mdash;only
an impression of the wonderful and the great remained;
and I loved Paris more as a conqueror.</p>

<p>Over the housetops I swung in great circles. Little
dots in the streets showed me that crowds were gathering.
They could not understand how a German could
handle the French invention more skilfully and advantageously
than the French themselves. They began to
shoot at us. It was fine. They were very bad shots. I
felt like dropping a bomb&mdash;not to kill them, but simply
to see something blown up. Then from the direction of
Juvisy came a French monoplane. As it was more swift
than my biplane, I had to turn and try to escape. My
Bavarian comrade prepared my rifle and seized his pistol.
The Frenchman approached closer and closer. I attempted
to reach the protecting clouds at 6,000 feet, but
my pursuer flew swifter than we, ever nearer and nearer.
Suddenly I became aware of a second monoplane only
500 yards away. It attempted to block my path. We
had to act. I shot at the airman ahead of us. Then a
turn and the Major took aim. He shot once, twice,
three times. The enemy's machine, which was now next
to us only 100 yards away, toppled, tilted upward, and
then fell to the ground like a stone. But our other pursuer
was almost on top of us and shot at us with pistols.
Close to the gas lever a bullet hit the fuselage. Then
impenetrable fog concealed us from the enemy. I could
hear the buzz of his motor grow fainter and fainter.</p>

<p>When we again emerged from this gray ocean of clouds
it was twilight. But suddenly, before, behind and on the
sides, white smoke clouds appeared bursting shrapnel.
Still flying above the enemy's position, we were directly
exposed to their artillery fire. Devil with it! The fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
grew worse. I knew from the little trembles that the
machine was getting blow upon blow, but it never entered
my mind that those shrapnel balls meant death to me.
Something in man remains unmoved by logic and knowledge&mdash;especially
when you're in the air. There, of a
sudden, a white-yellow fire in front of me. The machine
reared up. The major seemed to reel to his feet. Blood
was pouring from his shoulder. The covering of the
wings was tattered. The motor buzzed and roared as
before, but the screw was missing. A grenat shattered
our propellor, but, thank heaven, did no worse. My
machine began sinking to earth. I succeeded in gliding
and threw the biplane down into the woods. The
branches and tree tops crashed to splinters. I struck the
steering gear and then was no longer aware of what went
on around me. When I again became conscious I was
lying next to Major G. on the forest ground surrounded
by a group of German reservists. Recognizing the machine,
they had forced themselves into the forest in small
numbers to save us. Major G. had to be removed to the
nearest hospital. I only received a crushed leg.</p>

<h2>TALES FROM SIBERIA&mdash;WHEN THE
PRISON DOORS OPENED</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Journey Home of a Hundred Thousand Exiles</i><br /><br />
<i>Told by (name withheld), an Eye-Witness</i></div>


<h3>I&mdash;"RUSSIA IS A REPUBLIC&mdash;YOU ARE
FREE"</h3>

<p>The exiles in the Irkutsk prisons were watching eight
fellow prisoners who were being flogged. Suddenly, in
the doorway, an official appeared. It was the Provincial
State Attorney. There was a look of great tidings in
his face.</p>

<p>"Russia is a republic," he cried. "You are free."</p>

<p>The news of the revolution had reached across the vast
stretches of Siberia. It was a moment of tense excitement.
Bewilderment and then jubilation beset the exiles.
An hour later began one of the strangest spectacles
in modern history&mdash;the exodus from Siberia. It is estimated
that a hundred thousand political exiles began their
race back to Russia.</p>

<p>Traveling from the most inaccessible mines and settlements,
they journeyed by sledge or trudged on foot to
the nearest point on the Trans-Siberian railway. It was
a race against time. The Spring thaw was approaching.
If the exiles did not reach the railroad within two weeks
the roads would be impassable. The wilderness would
become a sea of mud. Far in the north, in the coldest
settlements of the lower Lena, it would be impossible
to move forward until the ice breaks on the river two
months later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>The first large party consisted of one hundred and
fifty political convicts and administrative exiles, including
twenty members of the Jewish revolutionary band. The
exiles were traveling in special cars and had been on the
road continuously from March 24, five days after they
first heard of the revolution.</p>

<p>The cars were met by a vast crowd at the railroad-station,
which cheered them tumultuously. The returning
exiles returned the cheers, but they were in a deplorable
physical condition&mdash;shaggy, uncouth, unwashed,
and extremely emaciated.</p>

<p>Many were crippled with rheumatism, two had lost
hands and feet from frostbites, and one, who attempted
flight a week before the revolution, had been shot in the
leg when he was recaptured. He was lying in a prison-hospital
when he learned that he was a free man.</p>

<p>Five days after the triumph of the revolution 6,000
exiles entered Irkutsk, but the vast majority were unable
to proceed west, owing to the lack of rolling-stock.
These encamped about the town and along the railroad,
and at least a month will be needed before they can be
sent home.</p>

<p>The crowds at Tyumen cheered the famous terrorist,
Nicolai Anuikhin, who shot and killed the chief of the
Petrograd-Warsaw Railway in 1906. His victim, General
Fuchloff, was about to kidnap 400 railroad strikers
and send them to Siberia.</p>

<p>Anuikhin, who introduced himself as "a released jailbird,"
is a gigantic, broad-shouldered, elderly man, with a
gray imperial and an excited manner of speech. He said:</p>

<p>"After one year in European convict prisons I spent
ten years in the Alexandrovsk prison, fifty miles from
Irkutsk. This is the biggest convict jail in Russia and
contained 12,000 ordinary criminals and about 500 political
prisoners, mostly sentenced to life <i>katroga</i>, the severest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
form of Russian punishment short of death.</p>

<p>"I spent the first five years in the so-called probation
class, with hands and feet manacled and chained to a
wheelbarrow which I had to take everywhere. In addition
I was repeatedly flogged by order of the Governor.
The Assistant Governor, during the absence of his chief,
ordered daily floggings for his own satisfaction.</p>

<p>"The occupants of the different dormitories communicated
by means of tappings and other systems of signaling.
Although we also had means of communication
with the outside world, we knew nothing of the revolution
until the morning of our release.</p>

<p>"After our release we learned that the Assistant Governor,
on getting the news of the revolution, declared that
he would give a farewell flogging, 'in order to prepare
my jailbirds for sweet liberty.'"</p>

<p>Among the political prisoners from Tobolsk was Alexander
Popoff. He was sentenced to death for an alleged
plot against the Emperor, a charge which he declares
was a fabrication by the police. Popoff, who is a highly
intelligent artizan, was chained by the wrists and ankles
for four years. In describing his release, he says:</p>

<p>"A most remarkable feature of amnesty day in Tobolsk
was the sudden demand for blacksmiths. The
prison blacksmith, fearing the vengeance of the convicts,
fled, and private blacksmiths, in the general orgy of revolutionary
triumph, could not be found.</p>

<p>"In the meantime sixty chained men waited for their
liberation. The newly formed committee of public safety,
unable to find blacksmiths, drove the still chained convicts
to the dismissed Governor's palace, where a banquet had
been prepared, and we had our first free meal. Above
the din of speeches and cheers for the Russian Republic
could be heard the jangling of our shackles."</p>

<p>The news of the revolution reached the prisoners in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Siberia by various channels, but in all cases the announcement
was unexpected and dramatic. In several places
the police were wise enough to tell the news themselves
in order to escape the danger of suddenly finding themselves
in the power of men they had abused with impunity
for years. The exiles rarely rose against their jailers.
Basil Muravin, once a social revolutionist, tells this story:</p>

<p>"When the revolution occurred I was in the small
Udinsk transport-prison awaiting the arrival of other
convicts for dispatch together to the east. I had long
lost hope of pardon when I learned that I was free. The
discovery came in a most dramatic way. I was at the
time in chains as a newcomer of unknown character. I
heard a sudden shouting and afterward a terrific rifle-firing.
It sounded as if a million cartridges had exploded
in quick succession.</p>

<p>"Next bullets began to fly over the prison-yard. Finally
a bullet cut the halyard of the Russian flag which
waved over the prison-building. The flag dropped on the
roof and shortly afterward a crowd stormed the prison
and hoisted there a revolutionary ensign. My last experience
of the old régime was a visit by the former Governor
of the jail, who, fearing retaliation, begged me to
sign a statement acquitting him of ill-treatment. Though
his treatment of the convicts had been bad, I agreed,
not desiring to mar Russia's new freedom by acts of petty
vengeance."</p>

<p>In another case the priests announced the revolution
in the churches.</p>

<p>Fifty exiles, who were in the congregation, rushed out,
determined on vengeance on the local police-captain, who
was a wanton tyrant. They were met by the policeman's
ten-year-old daughter, who stood before her father and
exclaimed, "Kill me first!" The child's action saved the
captain's life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>


<h3>II&mdash;STORY OF THE HUSSAR WHO ESCAPED
FROM SIBERIA</h3>

<p>This is the tale of a Hussar who had escaped twice
from Russian prisons, faced murder, come half-round the
world, and ran the British blockade. He was a reserve
officer in the Austrian Army, a Hungarian captain in a
famous regiment of Hussars. He was stationed in the
fortress at Peremysl when the Russians advanced into
the Karpathians and took the city. Taken prisoner, he
was marched off to a detention camp near the front where
the officers were separated from the soldiers. The men
disappeared, but the officers were taken to a military
prison near Odessa.</p>

<p>The prison fare was not particularly bad, but the monotony
of the place was dreadful. Shut up as they were
without anything to think of, they began to have all kinds
of imaginary grievances&mdash;principally against one another.
"If half the challenges to deadly combat are carried out
there will be a duel a minute after the war," he says.
It got to be positively ludicrous. Pompous and sensitive
enough in all conscience in ordinary circumstances, the
German and Austrian officers, under the nervous conditions
of prison life, lived under a hair-trigger. If you
accidentally bumped into a man on your morning walk,
or if you forgot to bow in the usual manner, you promptly
had a challenge to a duel&mdash;to be fought after the war, as
there was nothing to fight with in prison.</p>

<p>Having been brought up along the Galician borders,
this Hungarian spoke Russian like a native. This fact
encouraged him to make an attempt to escape.</p>

<p>For some remarkable reason the Russians had allowed
the captured officers to retain all their money. He himself
had several thousand dollars in his pockets. When
it became whispered around that he intended to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
getaway, other officers asked him to carry money back
to their families. The result was that when he slipped
away he had nearly $30,000 in cash on his person.</p>

<p>He didn't tell me exactly how he managed to get away,
but I inferred that it was through the bribery of some of
the prison guards. At any rate he slipped out of the
prison one night and turned eastward. His general plan
was to make his way down through the passes of the
Caucasus Mountains through Armenia, and thence to
Turkey, where he would be safe.</p>

<p>Hiding by day and walking by night, he managed to
get to a half-civilized little hamlet on the edge of the
great mountains.</p>

<p>The wilderness of the journey before him left him
rather appalled. He had intended to buy a horse and try
to make his own way through, but he saw that this would
be impossible. It inevitably meant losing his way and
starving&mdash;if he were not killed by wandering bandits!</p>

<p>The town was full of wild-looking Kurdish mountaineers
armed to the teeth. He decided to open negotiations
with one of these to act as his guide. The first one approached
readily agreed to act as his guard, guide, and
escort on the long journey through the mountains. He
said the fellow was as dirty as a pig and looked as tough
as a Malay pirate, but his belt was filled like an arsenal.</p>

<p>Under his advice, the Hungarian officer bought a horse
for about three times what it was worth. The arrangements
were all made and they were to start the next morning
when the wife of the Kurdish peasant at whose hut
the Hungarian had taken lodging whispered him a word
of warning.</p>

<p>"Don't go with him," she said. "As soon as you are
one day out, he will kill you."</p>

<p>"Why should he kill me?" asked the Hussar.</p>

<p>The woman shrugged her shoulders. "Well, it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
long journey," she said, "why should he take all that
trouble when he could get your money in some other
way?"</p>

<p>Her logic was at least convincing if not reassuring.
The Hungarian took a little walk through the one street
of the town. In the light of her warning, he saw that all
the men there would kill a baby to get a drink of milk.
They looked vicious enough to commit any crime.</p>

<p>The Hussar sat down to think it over. If he tried to
go on through the mountains alone he would probably be
followed and killed, or assassinated for his rifle by the
wandering Kurdish tribes in the mountains. If his luck
was good enough to keep him from being shot, he would
lose his way and starve. If he went out with his guide,
it was simply a question of how long the man allowed
him to live. There was only one thing left to do&mdash;he
must get back to the prison from which he had escaped,
where he would find food, shelter, and safety.</p>

<p>He got up in the middle of the night, slipped out of
the hut, and took the trail again. Without a great deal
of difficulty he found his way back to the prison. A day
or two later the sentinel at the officers' prison was amazed
to see a Hungarian Hussar come nonchalantly up the road
and ask to be let into prison.</p>

<p>They led him before the Russian governor of the
prison who was furious.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Why," said the Hussar blindly, "I have always wanted
to see these wonderful mountains, so I just went out for
a day or two to see the scenery."</p>

<p>"What do you think this is, a summer resort?" roared
the Russian colonel.</p>

<p>The Hussar was ordered for a time into solitary confinement.
But the Russian commandant was a pretty
good fellow. Besides, with his education and his knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of Russian, the Hungarian was very useful about
the prison. So they restored him to favor very soon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his uniform had worn out. They had to
give him some kind of clothing, so they fitted him out with
the clothes of a Russian peasant.</p>

<p>The loose, easy-going discipline of the prison, his pockets
full of money, and these Russian clothes made escape
the second time ridiculously easy.</p>

<p>He said it could scarcely be called escaping. He literally
put on his hat and walked. He figured it out this
time that the way to avoid detection was not to hide
around dark corners; but to disarm suspicion by openly
mixing with the crowds.</p>

<p>Wherefore he went openly down the streets to the railroad-depot,
bought a ticket to Moscow in the ordinary
way, and traveled just like any other passenger.</p>

<p>At Moscow he stopped for several weeks. His story
became decidedly vague at this point.</p>

<p>He told me that he fell in with a woman who had the
<i>entrée</i> to army circles in Russia and that she got him a
card to a Russian officers' club where he hung around
for two weeks, mingling with the officers without his
nationality being suspected. The woman had in the
meantime dressed him up in good clothes and had changed
his Austrian money into Russian coinage.</p>

<p>The Hussar tried to give me the impression that the
woman had fallen a victim to his manly charms and had
thereby been induced to turn traitor to her country. I
couldn't quite believe this, he didn't look the part.</p>

<p>From what we have since learned of Russian conditions,
it seems very probable that, when the Hussar got
to Moscow, he hunted up the circle of German spies who
were operating there, reported for duty, and was taken
care of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Well, what am I going to do&mdash;stay here for the rest
of my life?" demanded the Hussar testily.</p>

<p>"Patience, my son," said the old man. "To-night there
is another train&mdash;a scrubby little local train that runs
back and forth across the border carrying the peasants
and traders. No one pays any attention to that train.
You will be on it when it goes out to-night."</p>

<p>When the local train left that night the Hussar was
one of the passengers. The others were dirty, badly
smelling Manchurian farmers.</p>

<p>But it carried him safely across the border and into
China. Without further difficulty he made his way to
America.</p>

<p>He was on his way to the Eastern coast and expected
to take ship for Austria within a month. When his companion
hinted that he would find it harder to get through
the British blockade than to hoodwink the Russian officials,
he winked. And sure enough, within three months
the Westerner had received a card from him. He was
back at his old table in the café of Peremysl, drinking
cool concoctions from tall glasses.</p>

OF THE <i>LUSITANIA</i></a></h2>

<div class="center">"<i>How We Saw Our Ship Go Down&mdash;Torpedoed
by a German Submarine</i>"<br /><br />
<i>Told by Passengers of the Ill-Fated "Lusitania"</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>These tragic stories are like voices from the grave&mdash;the ocean
giving up its dead. They are told by those who were saved
from the tragedy ship on that fearful day, May 7, 1915 (at 2:08
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Greenwich time) when the <i>Lusitania</i>, fifteen miles off "Old
Head of Winsale" on the Irish coast, was torpedoed by a German
submarine. The <i>Lusitania</i> sailed from New York at noon,
May 1, 1915, carrying 1,959 persons&mdash;passengers and crew. It
had been warned by official notices from the German embassy
that it would be attacked by German submarines, which only
aggravates the crime by making plain its deliberate intention.
The voyage was uneventful until the seventh, when the ship,
running at 17 knots, was nearing its destination. It was shortly
after luncheon, the sea was calm, when two torpedoes struck
the <i>Lusitania</i>. The scenes of terror which followed are described
by the survivors&mdash;a few of their stories, typical of their
fearful experiences, are told here. The ship sank in less than
twenty minutes, and 1,198 men, women, and children went down
into an ocean grave.</p></blockquote>


<h3>I&mdash;STORY OF CAPTAIN W. T. TURNER, COMMANDER
OF THE "LUSITANIA"</h3>

<p>I was on the bridge of the <i>Lusitania</i> (at 2:08 Friday
afternoon, May 7, 1915, off Old Head of Kinsdale on
Irish Coast) when I saw a torpedo speeding toward us,
and immediately I tried to change our course, but was
unable to man[oe]uvre out of its way. There was a terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
impact as the torpedo struck the starboard side of the
vessel, and a second torpedo followed almost immediately.
This one struck squarely over the boilers. I tried
to turn the <i>Lusitania</i> shoreward, hoping to beach her,
but her engines were crippled and it was impossible.
Until the <i>Lusitania</i> came to a standstill it was absolutely
out of the question to launch the boats&mdash;they would have
been swamped. It has been suggested that it was impact
with ammunition in the cargo that made the work of the
torpedoes so deadly, but if there had been ammunition
in the cargo the <i>Lusitania</i> would have been blown to
pieces. I saw the torpedoes with my own eyes as did
many others. It was cold-blooded murder.</p>

<p>I was in the water four hours after the <i>Lusitania</i> sank.
I am a strong swimmer, and so was able to keep afloat
until I was rescued. When I was swimming about, suddenly
a German submarine rose to the surface amid the
wreckage, then submerged again. Some persons in lifeboats
nearby saw the submarine even better than I did.</p>

<p>(As Captain Turner went about the streets of Queenstown
he tried bravely to cheer the survivors, but he
seemed stunned. For the most part he walked with
bowed head, and many of those he met did not recognize
him. When told of the recovery of Charles Frohman's
body, and of the finding of many other Americans among
the dead, tears came to his eyes.)</p>


<h3>II&mdash;STORY TOLD BY W. B. PHILLIPS, AN
AMERICAN PASSENGER</h3>

<p>It was seven or eight minutes after 2 o'clock when the
torpedo struck us, and my watch stopped at 2:33, when I
went into the water a half minute before the <i>Lusitania</i>
disappeared. Captain Turner was on the bridge when the
ship went down, and the last order I heard him give was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
"Hard aport," just before the torpedo struck. It seems
as though he was trying to turn the ship to escape the
torpedo. I rushed on deck, but met two women in the
companionway who shouted "torpedo"! I rushed back
to my stateroom for some belongings, but as the water
was coming through the promenade deck I didn't wait, but
rushed back to the deck again. Most everybody went
to the cabins for life preservers. There was no panic,
though lots of excitement. Not even a panic when the
ship went down.</p>

<p>The worst thing was the inefficiency with the lifeboats.
On the port side many of the davits wouldn't work and
the boats would not go over. The tackle broke on one of
four or five boats I saw lowered, while one dropped from
the davits and split in two. A few of the collapsible
boats floated away upside down, while one raft, which
some one cut away with an axe, crushed some men who
were trying to climb into a boat.</p>

<p>There was a great whirlpool when the <i>Lusitania</i>
finally settled into the sea, but no suction. I was drawn
into the whirlpool, but had no trouble in swimming out.
She went down very fast at one end. Our boat, which
was the most crowded of all, with eighty-four in it, was
almost swamped by the wireless antennæ, which swept
across us as the <i>Lusitania</i> keeled over for the last time
before she righted and sank.</p>

<p>The daughter of Lady Allan told me she saw the submarine,
but I know of no one else who did. Shots were
fired while we were in the small boats, about twenty
minutes after the <i>Lusitania</i> sank, but I don't know if
they were from the submarine. They might have been
signals from land. The only boat in sight was a fishing
smack, or pilot boat, three or four miles away. There
was smoke on the horizon, and one vessel seemed to be
coming up, but she sheered off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>The wireless operator told me he got in four wireless
signals and got an answer to the last one. The boats
rowed toward the smack, which took part of the people
on board and towed two other boatloads. It was 5 o'clock
when we were picked up, and at that time no boat was
anywhere near the scene of the wreck. One trawler got
to the wreck about 5:30. It was followed by two torpedo
boats and eight or nine other boats. Captain Turner had
ordered some lifeboats swung over the side on Wednesday
and all swung over on Thursday morning, but the
rafts and collapsible boats were not touched, but remained
securely fastened. There was plenty of boat accommodation
if there had been time to get them over.</p>

<p>The men all waited until no women were in sight before
they went into the boats. I never believed it true
before, but there seemed to be a regular chorus all the
time on the <i>Lusitania</i>: "Women first! Women first!"</p>


<h3>III&mdash;STORY OF OLIVER P. BERNARD, AN
ENGLISH PASSENGER</h3>

<p>I think I can say that I was one of the few persons
who really saw a torpedo discharged at the <i>Lusitania</i>.
Coming on deck from the dining saloon. I was leaning
against the starboard rail of the ship when I saw the
periscope of a submarine about two hundred yards away.
Then I noticed a long white streak of foam. It gave me
the impression of frothy fizzing in water. A woman
came to me and said: "There's a torpedo coming." Before
she had finished the explosion took place and tons
of debris were blown up through the four decks. Almost
immediately there was a terrific impact, followed by an
explosion. The <i>Lusitania</i> was going at fifteen knots at
the time. The shot was perfectly aimed at the boat, and
when it struck, debris, dust and water were thrown up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
a dense column through the entire superstructure of the
vessel about the bridge. A hundred must have been
blown to atoms, including trimmers and stokers, to say
nothing of men and women in the forward cabins, who
were about to come on deck.</p>

<p>The <i>Lusitania</i> fell over to starboard and then slowly
righted part way. Nearly every one rushed below. I
went to the flying deck and stood between the funnels,
where I could see them making an awful mess of getting
the boats out. They were cutting and hacking at them.
The first boat floated away empty. The next three were
smashed. The Marconi main room was put out of commission
by the first torpedo; then the wireless operator
rushed to the emergency room, and just as he got the
first reply to the "S. O. S." the whole apparatus went out
of action.</p>

<p>The first torpedo hit amidship by the grand entrance
to the saloon and rear of the bridge. A Marconi man
rushed to me and offered me a chair, and said I had
better take that, as it might be useful and better than
nothing.</p>

<p>A few moments after the explosion the vessel toppled
over, as if she were in drydock and some of the underpinning
on the starboard side had been knocked away.
There was a frantic dash from the starboard entrances
to the port side and from below women were shouting,
"What shall we do?" They knew well what had happened,
as the chance of being torpedoed was discussed
every day. I heard nothing else on the voyage. When
the <i>Lusitania</i> listed still more I slid off the flying deck
on to the boat deck, and from there fell into a boat lying
alongside. As I got into the boat she was swept almost
away by one of the funnels falling across her, and we
only managed to push clear. I saw a minister's wife
sucked right down one of the funnels and shot out again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
looking like a piece of burned coal. We managed to
save her. I rowed for some time with a woman between
my knees before discovering that she was dead.</p>

<p>There was no great excitement, in the real sense of the
word. Most of the women tried hard to keep cool, and
except for occasional screams of "Where is my husband?
Where is my child?" they acted bravely. I noticed more
people going below than coming on deck after the explosion.
The last person I spoke to before the vessel
went down was Mrs. Mason, the young American daughter
of William Lindsay, a manufacturer of Boston, who
was on her honeymoon. She was asking for her husband.</p>

<p>Alfred Vanderbilt I saw standing outside the grand
entrance of the saloon, looking quite happy and perfectly
composed. He was holding a jewel case for a lady, for
whom he was apparently waiting. I did not see Charles
Frohman until I saw his body in a mortuary. His was
the most peaceful face among all those I saw there.
There was no trace of agony, and unlike others his features
were not disfigured in any way. Frohman was none
too well on the voyage, and was hardly able to walk, so
he remained in his cabin most of the time, where, I believe,
he was when the ship sank. Elbert Hubbard and
his wife I also believe went down in their cabin.</p>

<p>The first two boats from the port side were manned
principally by officers. The slow speed gave the Germans
an absolutely pointblank shot. They couldn't miss. Only
God's fair weather and daylight brought us ashore. If
the <i>Lusitania</i> had been convoyed or had put on speed she
would have been here now.</p>

<p>The wireless operators were still sending out calls from
their emergency apparatus, the main wireless room having
been disorganized. The ship was now listing badly
to starboard, and, taking a swivel chair which an operator
offered to me, I slid down into the water and to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
boat which was still attached to the davits and which was
partly covered with water. We cleared the boat not a
moment too soon, for we had hardly done so when the
vessel went down on the starboard side, one of the funnels
grazing our heads. In the twinkling of an eye the
monster vessel disappeared amidst the cries of those who
had been caught. It was one long indescribable scene of
agony. There was floating debris on all sides and men
and women and children clinging for dear life to deck
chairs and rafts which littered the water. Many were
entangled in wreckage, and one by one they seemed to
fall off and give themselves up.</p>

<p>About the last thing I saw happen on the boat was the
chief Marconi operator taking a photograph when the
vessel was listed to 45 degrees, but the pictures were
spoiled by the water. We rowed around for three and a
half hours before we were picked up.</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;STORY TOLD BY GEORGE A. KESSLER, AN
AMERICAN PASSENGER</h3>

<p>I saw the wake of the first torpedo the moment before
the <i>Lusitania</i> was struck. I was on the upper deck.
Looking out to sea, I saw all at once the wash of a
torpedo, indicated by the snakelike churn on the surface
of the water. It was about thirty feet away. Then came
the thud as it struck the ship. Mr. Berth and his wife,
of New York, first class passengers, were the last persons
I spoke to on the ship. About this time all the passengers
in the dining saloon had come up on deck. The
upper deck was crowded, and the passengers were wondering
what was the matter, few really believing that
the ship had been torpedoed. They began to lower boats.
I saw Berth help his wife into a boat. I fell into the
same boat and we were shipped down into the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>About a minute after the boat struck the water, I
looked up and cried out: "My God! The <i>Lusitania</i> is
gone!" We saw her entire bulk, which had been almost
upright just a few seconds before, suddenly lurch over
away from us. Then she seemed to stand upright in
the water and the next instant the keel of the vessel
caught the keel of our boat and we were thrown into the
water. There were only about thirty people in the boat
and I should say that all were stokers or third class
passengers.</p>

<p>When the boat was overturned I sank fifteen or twenty
feet and I thought I was a goner. However, I had my
lifebelt around me and I managed to rise again to the
surface. There I floated for possibly ten or fifteen minutes,
when I made a grab at a collapsible lifeboat, to which
other passengers were clinging. We managed to get it
shipshape and clamber in. There were eight or nine in
the boat. It was partly filled with water, and in the
scramble which occurred the boat overturned, and once
more we were pitched into the water. This occurred, I
should say, eight times, the boat righting itself each time.
Before we were picked up by the <i>Bluebell</i> six of the
party of eight or nine were lying drowned in the bilge
water in the bottom of the boat. It was cold-blooded,
deliberate murder and nothing else&mdash;the greatest murder
the world has ever known.</p>


<h3>V&mdash;STORY OF CHARLES T. JEFFREY, AN AMERICAN
PASSENGER</h3>

<p>I was in the smoking room when the explosion took
place. It shook the whole ship, just as a train would
shake if the locomotive suddenly stopped and backed
into it. I did not, of course, know what it was, and it
did not occur to me that we had been torpedoed. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
thought it might be a mine, or that we had run upon a
rock, but it simply did not occur to my mind to imagine
anything so horrible as that this defenseless ship with its
helpless passengers would be torpedoed without warning.</p>

<p>I left the smoking room and went out on deck to look
over the side at the spot where the ship was when the
explosion took place. It was about 300 feet away. The
ship began to take a list to starboard, but very slowly.
There was no panic, either then or at any other time.
Many other passengers came out and looked over the side,
just as I did, but there were no signs of alarm or any
rushing about.</p>

<p>I went down to "A" deck to see what was happening
there, but there was no commotion, any more than there
was on the upper one, to which I returned. But the
ship was listing more and more. The lifeboats had been
swung out the previous day, and I saw women and children
being put into them by sailors. There was no rushing
for the boats, no struggling for places; everything
was being done with perfect calmness and orderliness. I
went down to my cabin, meeting many people in the
alleyways with lifebelts and others going for them.</p>

<p>I made my way aft, and seeing no one on the navigating
bridge, scrambled up there, where I could observe
everything that was happening along one side of the ship.
The ship now heeled over so much that the passengers
were clinging to the deck rail. It was a terrible sight;
their helplessness, with the great ship steadily going down
under us.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a terrific rumbling, roaring noise;
the huge ship trembled as her funnels went over, and
she just slid under the waves by the head. Then she
seemed to be suddenly checked, as though her bow had
struck something, but it was only momentary, and in another
moment she disappeared under the water. I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
down with her, but came to the surface again very
quickly. All around me I saw great numbers of persons
struggling in the water. Presently there floated near me
a rectangular sheet metal can, like the air tank of a
lifeboat, and I clutched it. I waited for a rescuer, but
there was none in sight. Then two men came along,
hanging on to a barrel with handles on each end, so I
brought my tank over and caught on to it for company.
We were hanging on for some time, when a man of
seventy-five and a boy of seventeen came along on a
plank. The boy could not swim. We caught them and
added them and their plank to our party.</p>

<p>After another twenty minutes or so we saw in the
distance what looked like a raft, so we swam toward it,
pushing our supports. It took us nearly half an hour to
reach that raft, and it turned out to be a collapsible boat.</p>

<p>We were in this boat some time, and were taking in
water steadily, when a man weighing perhaps 250 pounds
floated by, without any life preserver. He was all in,
but we got him aboard. Next a foreigner, who could
speak no English, got in with us. Then a woman floated
along with a deck chair and an oar, and we took her
aboard, but it was doubtful how long we could remain
afloat, so one man took the can I spoke of and pushed
off on his own account.</p>

<p>At last, at 6.10, after four hours in the water, the
trawler took us in. We were stiff and cold, and went
down to the engine room to dry our clothes. We were
tended with the greatest care by the crew. It was an
experience no man would like to face again, and those
who went through it will have a lasting memory of its
horror. Why, I remember on the voyage over remarking
that I never saw so many babies and young children on
any ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI&mdash;STORY TOLD BY DR. DANIEL V. MOORE,
AN AMERICAN PASSENGER</h3>

<p>After the explosion quiet and order were soon accomplished
by assurances from the stewards. I proceeded to
the deck promenade for observation and saw only that
the ship was fast leaning to starboard. I hurried toward
my cabin below for a lifebelt and turned back because of
the difficulty in keeping upright. I struggled to D deck
and forward to the first-class cabin, where I saw a
Catholic priest.</p>

<p>I could find no belts and returned again toward E deck
and saw a stewardess struggling to dislodge a belt. I
helped her with hers and secured one for myself. I
then rushed to D deck and noticed one woman perched
on the gunwale, watching a lowering lifeboat ten feet
away. I pushed her down and into the boat, then jumped
in. The stern of the lifeboat continued to lower, but
the bow stuck fast. A stoker cut the bow ropes with a
hatchet, and we dropped in a vertical position.</p>

<p>A girl whom we had heard sing at a concert was struggling
and I caught her by the ankle and pulled her in.
A man I grasped by the shoulders and I landed him safe.
He was the barber of the first-class cabin, and a more
manly man I never met. He showed his courage and his
will later on.</p>

<p>We pushed away hard to avoid the suck, but our boat
was fast filling and we bailed fast with one bucket and
the women's hats. The man with the bucket became exhausted
and I relieved him. In a few minutes she was
level full. Then a keg floated up and I pitched it about
ten feet away and followed it. After reaching it I turned
to see the fate of our boat. She had capsized and covered
many. Now a young steward, Freeman, by name,
had approached me, clinging to a deck chair. I urged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
him to grab the other side of the keg several times.
He grew faint, but harsh speaking roused him. Once
he said: "I am going to go," but I ridiculed this and
it gave him strength. By stroking with our legs we succeeded
in reaching a raft.</p>

<p>We were in the water about one hour and a half. At
this time I suffered from violent vomiting. Then followed
appalling chills, but by beating myself I restored
my energy and was soon handling an oar. Freeman collapsed,
but recovered after reaching the patrol boat
<i>Brock</i>. There were about twenty-three persons on the
raft. They worked nobly in picking five of us up after
what seemed an eternity.</p>

<p>The good boat <i>Brock</i> and her splendid officers and
men took us aboard. I went to the engine room and
stripped to the skin. Here and in the room above I
cared for men and women as they were rescued. Little
ten-year-old Frank Hook had his left thigh bone fractured.
This I reduced and splinted, and in a short while
Frank asked, "Is there a funny paper on the boat?"</p>

<p>At the scene of the catastrophe the surface of the
water seemed dotted with bodies. Only a few of the lifeboats
seemed to be doing any good. The cries of "My
God!" "Save us!" and "Help!" gradually grew weaker
from all sides and finally a low weeping, wailing, inarticulate
sound, mingled with coughing and gurgling, made
me heartsick. I saw many men die. Some appeared to
be sleepy and worn out just before they went down,
others grew gradually blue and an air of hunger gave
their features a sardonic smile.</p>

<p>There was no suction when the ship settled. She went
down steadily and at the best possible angle. The lifeboats
were not in order and they were not manned. Most
of the people rushed to the upper decks.</p>

<p>I did not hear a second explosion. There is no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
horrible or pitiable sight possible than the sight of the
faces of mothers and babies and girls here in the
morgues.</p>

<p>Weighing all the facts soberly convinces me that it
was only through the mercy of God that any one was
saved. I sailed from America that I might offer my
services as a surgeon. I have visited the Valley of Death
and am heartsick.</p>


<h3>VII&mdash;STORY OF FUNERAL OF "LUSITANIA'S"
DEAD&mdash;TOLD BY AN EYE-WITNESS</h3>

<p>Ninety-two passengers of the <i>Lusitania</i> who formed
part of that pitiful handful of maimed, dead and dying
brought ashore with the survivors of the disaster that
followed the attack on the vessel by a German submarine
were buried with services that have no parallel in history.
Under a sky in which not a single cloud floated and to the
strains of hymns played by British soldiers they were
laid to rest two miles behind Queenstown in a cemetery
bursting with spring greenery and tucked between hills
flaming with gorse. The services at the graves began
at four o'clock, and at half-past four the sod of Ireland
was being shovelled upon the coffins.</p>

<p>Queenstown sensed the full horror of the <i>Lusitania</i>
disaster. Up to the time that the long stream of coffins
began to disappear over the hill behind the town there
was about the affair, what with the continued searches for
survivors and the bustle about the morgue, something of
the unusual and theatric. But when the funeral started
the realization came that each of these cheap coffins held
a body and that in the Atlantic, less than twenty miles
away, there were more than a thousand in addition, all
victims of a German submarine.</p>

<p>The townsfolk stood hatless nearly all forenoon as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
coffins were conveyed to the cemetery on carts. This
process required hours, and it was not until three o'clock
in the afternoon that the funeral procession proper left
the Cunard offices at the waterfront. There were only
three bodies, one each in a hearse, in this cortège, the
other eighty-nine already having been placed in the
graves.</p>

<p>With the British army band playing Chopin's "Funeral
March" the funeral procession marched through the
crooked streets past the cathedral, which stands on the
highest point of the town, and then took its course along
an undulating country road, now rising and now sinking
between green hills. Along this road country folk were
clustered for the most part, perched on stone fences behind
the soldiers who guarded the road the entire two
miles from the cathedral to the cemetery. Those waiting
in the graveyard first heard, borne faintly on the soft
breeze, the notes of the funeral march and then the
sound of muffled drums. A moment later the sun flashed
on the band instruments and the cortège took form in
the distance. Not for more than an hour, however, did
it reach the lane bordering the cemetery, which it entered
in the following order:&mdash;</p>

<p>A major of the Royal Irish infantry on horseback, five
members of the Irish Constabulary and a group of
Protestant churchmen, then in black robes came thirteen
priests, and behind them were the hearses, draped with
British flags, to the rear of which trudged the mourners,
among them several American survivors of the disaster.</p>

<p>The sailors from the steamship <i>Wayfarer</i>, which was
recently torpedoed but was able to make port, came next,
and behind them the members of the Corporation of
Cork, headed by the Lord Mayor. A company of marines
followed and then came sailors of the various
British ships in harbor. The British officers, numbering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
a hundred odd, marched erect but slow. Next in line
were captains Miller and Castle, Attachés of the American
Embassy in London. Both were dressed in khaki
uniforms. A party of British naval officers and Admiral
Sir Charles Coke, of Queenstown, followed them. The
Most Reverend Robert Browne, Bishop of Cloyne, rode
in a carriage.</p>

<p>The procession was a full hour in passing into the
cemetery. There soldiers guarded the walls as six other
soldier pallbearers lifted the coffins from the hearses
and set them beside the graves. The three coffins rested
beside separate graves. The other eighty-nine had previously
been placed in three great pits&mdash;sixty-five in one,
in layers two deep, and twelve each in the other two. Conducted
by Bishop Browne, the Catholic service was held
first, the choir boys bearing incense, appearing from a
cluster of elms and coming to the graveside. The Church
of Ireland service, that is, the Protestant Episcopal, followed,
and finally the non-conformist rites were performed.
As the last words of this service were spoken
the muffled drums rolled and the familiar hymn, "Abide
with Me," swelled forth. Sailors who had replaced the
soldier pallbearers then lowered the coffins into the small
graves, and simultaneously the earth began to thud on
the coffins in all the graves. The crowd, nearly all with
eyes wet, slowly left, some to take jaunting cars, but most
of them to trudge across the fields of the city. As they
reached the crest of the hill immediately above the harbor
flashed into view and in it the flag of every vessel fluttered
at half mast.</p>

<p>Many children and little babies lie in the morgues like
so many dolls. The townspeople covered them with flowers
yesterday and it is probable these little ones will be
placed in a grave together.</p>

<h3>I&mdash;STORY OF LIFE OF THE AMERICAN
SOLDIER</h3>

<div class="center">(Told by Private Joseph A. Deegan, of the Eleventh
Railway Engineers)</div>

<p><i>The daily life of the American soldiers and their relations
with those of other nations is an intimate and interesting
phase of the war concerning which little has been
published. Here is a description of them among the
French, the Chinese laborers and Hindus and the German
trenches:</i></p>

<p>Fine is no name for the way I feel. The climate in
the part of France we have finally settled in is just betwixt
and between. It is lukewarm. Over in England it
was rain, rain, rain. Everything was wet and muddy.
We slept and ate in mud right up to our mustaches.
However, the blooming little isle had its good points, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
I ought not to knock it. London gave us a royal welcome,
and I now have a few good friends there. A live
time also awaits me if I ever go back to Exeter, Aldershot
or Folkestone.</p>

<p>But turning the film back to La Belle France, here we
have nice climate, an exciting war, excellent champagne
and a set of girls that would make the boys back home
green with envy. What more could a man ask? The
only trouble with the French people is their unfailing
habit of trying to overcharge us. However, we are getting
on to their curves now and take discounts off every
price they ask. For instance, when I go into a candy
shop the proprietress will exclaim: "Ah, <i>bon Americain</i>."
Then she will proceed to quote me one and one-half
francs for a bar of five-cent chocolate. After a little
hesitation and figuring on my part I slip her half a franc,
and even at that she is making a 75 per cent profit. She
accepts the slight reduction with a deprecating air, and
probably mutters to herself: "Those Yankees are as stupid
as foxes." Aside from our little monetary differences
we and the French are the most affectionate of comrades.</p>

<p>Somewhere in France we camped next door to a Chinese
labor camp. There was a small army of them. The
Mongolians are the best pals we have run into yet. They
were so honored by the attention paid to them by the
whites that they broke their necks to please us. When
I said to a Chink: "Gimme a cigarette, Charlie," he
would run a quarter of a mile to his tent and come back
with a fistful. Some of the Chinks even wanted to lend
money to our boys. Unfortunately, however, our bunch
got to selling them, at exorbitant prices, gold rings that
after a rainstorm resembled the Irish flag, and wrist
watches with the small item of works entirely missing.
The English soldiers sort of wised up the Yellow Perils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
to our tricks and before we parted company with them
they became noticeably cool toward us. Well, they were
Coolies, anyhow. That's a cool joke.</p>

<p>Lower down in France we were camped directly opposite
a tribe of Hindus&mdash;you know, the kind with
knotted Turkish towels for hats. These birds bury and
pick the pockets of all soldiers killed on the front, so
you cannot sell them trinkets. They have carloads of
them. The Hindus are surlier and dirtier than the Chinese
gentlemen, and we did not mingle with them so
freely. If you want to get them drawing knives just
holler, "Buddha <i>no bon!</i>" They are fanatics on religion.
About a week ago we visited their camp and they immediately
challenged us to a tug of war. They had about
twelve on one end of the rope and we had only seven.
Evidently, however, they are not over strong, because
we pulled them almost up to the firing line. They are
hard losers, and might have drawn their bowies, but I
think they suspected we were Irish, so they remained
peaceable.</p>

<p>The guns play a constant tattoo at night, and I am getting
used to them now. The other day a few other fellows
and myself made a tour of inspection among some
recently deserted German trenches up near the line. In
them we found feather beds, a box of cigars and, last but
not least, a beautifully toned organ. The feather beds
were wet and coated with mud, so we couldn't bother
with them. You will say "Impossible" when I say I left
the cigars there also. This I did, however, as the Germans
have a playful habit of poisoning such dainties.
The organ was badly warped and too far below the
ground to attempt to salvage, but we stayed there for a
while and I made the subterranean passages echo to the
strains of "Ragging the Scale."</p>

<p>Another pet trick that the Germans employ is to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
a watch hanging on the wall of their abandoned trenches.
Said watch connects with a high explosive bomb which
explodes when the Ingersoll is removed from the wall.
The other night I was talking with a couple of English
soldiers, who told me that the English and Bavarians became
so friendly at one stage of the war that a squad
of the English soldiers crossed over to the German
trenches one night, had a little souse party with the Bavarians
and returned back to the allied trenches in the
morning. For this they were court-martialled. They
say that the Bavarians will frequently holler over to the
English not to fire any shots so that they can eat their
dinner in quiet, and they will reciprocate in like manner.
The English apparently have no hard feelings against
the Bavarians, but sure do hate the Prussians. Yesterday
I saw a vicious air fight. The German aviator looped
the loop with his machine fully a dozen times in order
to escape the machine-gun fire from the Allies' planes,
and escape he did, for I saw him shooting over the German
lines leaving his pursuers far behind.</p>

<p>Any German prisoners I see I always give them a
cheery, "<i>Wie gehts?</i>" and some of them answer "Good
morning" in English. They are sick of the war and
claim they are glad to be prisoners. Visited a large
French city the other day which the Germans had occupied
but which was recaptured by the French. No
human being could imagine the destruction that has been
wrought there. Among the thousands of houses there is
not a single one that could be lived in. Most of them are
beaten to dust, churches and everything else. An old
Frenchman there told me with tears in his eyes how his
daughter and the rest of the girls of the city had been
forcibly taken away by the Germans when they were
evacuating the city. I can now understand enough
French to converse in a broken way. The slogan here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
now is, "Give the Germans hell and take no prisoners."
From all stories and indications they have acted like barbarians
and deserve the worst treatment possible. Their
fire is becoming weaker and I think their days are numbered.
The Americans will put the finishing touches on
them, and don't be surprised if I send you a postcard
from Berlin some day.</p>


<h3>II&mdash;STORY OF A VOLUNTEER IN AMERICAN
RED CROSS</h3>

<div class="center">(Told by Edward J. Doyle, with American Army)</div>

<p><i>The experiences and the souvenirs&mdash;such as a piece of
shell shot through an ambulance and buttons cut from
the uniforms of German prisoners&mdash;of a volunteer in the
American Red Cross service are recorded in this letter.</i></p>

<p>Sherman was right, but he knows nothing about it. I
suppose by this time you know all about the attack, and
needless to say I have been through it all. Haven't had
my clothes off in over a week and my total sleep might
average about three hours a day for that time, so you can
imagine how I feel. We haven't been working all the
time, but we get shelled out of every place we try to
sleep, when we get a chance, and that's worse than working.
We are quite a way to the left of where I wrote
from last. We relieved a section that could not stand the
work&mdash;that was before the attack&mdash;and you can imagine
what it was during and since the attack.</p>

<p>We arrived at B&mdash;&mdash; a week ago this morning and
started in. That night the Germans shelled that town, and
imagine, it's about fifteen miles from the German lines.
We were alone in a barn, and when the shells began to
go over our heads and gas with it, you can see how much
sleep we had. Next morning Bud and I started out, and
the car is running rotten. The Germans are shelling the
road all the way from here. This is our first post out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
of R&mdash;&mdash;, about three miles from B&mdash;&mdash;. Don't try
to look up these towns; it's a useless task. Poste 4, a
like distance from R&mdash;&mdash;. We get in the middle of
Hill &mdash;&mdash;, about a mile from Poste 2, when the car
dies.</p>

<p>About 100 yards ahead of us is a crossroad and the
Boche is shelling it. Bud and I didn't realize where we
were, and all alone, mud over our shoe tops where we
stopped. We worked on the car for one and a half hours,
falling in the mud every time a German shell came
through the air. We got eleven holes in our car from
that morning, and a piece of shell went right through
an inch rod on the front of the car. I'll show you a picture
of that. We were the first in the section to get hit,
and how we escaped alive is the wonder of every
one who has seen the car, and we are always the center
of attraction when we stop along the road or at the postes.
I have a piece of shell that went through the car&mdash;a
souvenir. We were in the most dangerous part of the
whole woods&mdash;French guns on every side of us, but of
course we didn't know&mdash;and those were what the Germans
were after.</p>

<p>When we finally decided we couldn't get the car to
run we made for a nearby dugout, and a Frenchman there
told us we had our nerve. I left Bud there and walked
back to this post&mdash;about three and one-half miles&mdash;got
another car and towed our own back&mdash;that was our
baptism of fire, and it was plenty. We got our car fixed
up that day and worked all that night and the next day.
That night we were dead, and the damn Germans
shelled B&mdash;&mdash; again, and we had to get out twice during
the night and run for a nearby quarry, and no one
who has not been through it can imagine the feeling of
being awakened by hearing a shell go over your head,
and almost before you can get into your shoes and out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
of a place another drops near by. It's a thousand times
worse than being on a shelled road because you can see
a shell hit the road and invariably another follows&mdash;wait
for the second one to land and then beat it&mdash;some
sport.</p>

<p>I'm at P. J. Left now, our most advanced post with
the exception of one about a mile from here, which we
make only at night, as the Germans can see the road from
their first lines. They must have seen us on the road&mdash;some
plane of theirs&mdash;as they have been shelling here
ever since we arrived. We're in the dugout now and I
don't expect to find my car when I come out at the rate
the shells are landing around here.</p>

<p>Now for the attack. Sunday we were at Post 4&mdash;a
piece of shell just landed on my helmet. I'm just at the
entrance of the dugout&mdash;got to stop&mdash;it's getting too
warm.</p>

<p>Friday, 1:50 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;Just got out of P. J. Left. They
shelled it from 12 o'clock yesterday until 9:30 last night.
Blew up everything in sight but our dugout; killed a
couple of the brancardiers; blew up the kitchen, and you
should have seen what was left of our car&mdash;everything
was hit on the darn thing but the air in the tires.</p>

<p>The French made another attack last night on
Hill &mdash;&mdash; and took it. You have undoubtedly read
about it if you have followed the news. Back for the
attack now&mdash;Sunday we were at Post 4, that is, my car&mdash;and
we made a couple of trips from there, and all Sunday
night the woods were just ablaze with guns firing and
the boys went over the top at 4:40. All we carried that
night had been gassed and there was a bunch of them.
At 5:10 a car came to poste, saying they could not make
Poste 2&mdash;the road was blocked&mdash;so the lieutenant telephoned
and gave me a note to deliver to Poste 2&mdash;that
meant get it there. Well, we started out, and such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
sight! There was one whole ammunition train along
the road that had been shelled and gassed&mdash;every horse
dead&mdash;and not only horses. We got to Hill &mdash;&mdash;,
where Bud and I were stuck, and such a sight!</p>

<p>Two trains had been gassed, and we cut the horses
that were still alive from the carriages and then there was
a stampede. I shall never forget that morning&mdash;the road
blocked, shell holes, gas, dead horses, at least fifty of
them, in less distance than a city block, and this awful
racket. Well, we got the road cleared and made Poste
2, and there it was worse than ever. Our chief and sous-chief
and about six of our boys had been there all night,
gas masks on for nine hours. Two of them had shell
shock, another hysterical, and the dead and wounded all
around us. I'm poor at description, and you could never
picture such a scene. Well, we got a load and started
back. You could still cut the gas, and after we had gone
a way one of the couchés rapped on the window. We
stopped. The fellow on the top stretcher had died, his
head had fallen off the edge of the stretcher and he was
leaking from the mouth on the chap below. We took him
out, fixed his head on the stretcher and started on, shells
dropping all around us. How we ever got through no
one knows, but we did, and that's just the way things
went. Carried Boches and cut buttons off some of the
prisoners&mdash;have a Boche helmet and gas mask&mdash;souvenirs.</p>


<h3>III&mdash;STORY OF AN AMERICAN ENGINEER
IN FRANCE</h3>

<div class="center">(Told by (name suppressed), 11th Regiment Railway
Construction Engineers)</div>

<p><i>This member of Company D, 11th Regiment Railway
Construction Engineers, swings pick and axe and acts as
chauffeur on a handcar, but he enjoys it heartily.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>For several days we have been busy getting some new
drills, but unfortunately I am not at liberty to tell you the
nature of them.</p>

<p>All day yesterday was my own time, but I was too
busy cleaning up to write. The sun was shining most
of the day, for a change, so I was able to wash my
clothes, air my blankets, etc., and take a real bath.</p>

<p>We made stoves out of some large oil cans, and as we
have deep pans we boiled our clothes out and then
scrubbed them well on our washboard. But the real
treat was our bath. We walked about half a mile to a
British camp, where they have some bath. They have
rigged up a small room with live steam in it. We stood
in the room for at least a half hour and just perspired.
Then a cold shower and, believe me, for the first time
since I left home I was real clean.</p>

<p>Do you remember how you laughed at my army shoes
because they were so heavy? Well, you should see our
shoes now. They are the same as the Tommies wear in
the trenches. The soles are nearly as thick as the heels
on our other shoes. Besides, the heels and soles are
studded with iron plates and hobnails. Of course they
are very heavy, but for all of that they are very fine
shoes, as the wear in them surpasses the lighter American
shoe and they are better protection from water. We
have also discarded the canvas leggings and are now
wearing the spiral cloth puttees.</p>

<p>We are still in a rest camp belonging to the British,
but suppose we will be moving off to our own base in
the near future. The powers that be know best.</p>

<p>In the Base Camp&mdash;Hurrah! Received your package
yesterday in perfect condition, and maybe I wasn't happy,
also the squad, for of course they have to have some of
it. Best of all, the cigarettes and tobacco are real American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
products. I do not care for the English stuff. And
the candy&mdash;well, "nuf sed!"</p>

<p>Last night a number of us walked around a very interesting
battlefield. If I should give you its name you
would remember it as one of the famous ones of the war.
I have never seen so much junk lying round as there is
on this old battleground. Bullets, old shells, helmets,
guns and what not. There is so much stuff we did not
bother to pick it up. We found a number of English
rifles and shrapnel helmets, some with a lot of holes in
them. I guess the men who wore them are dead. As for
graves, well, in some spots they are as thick as daisies.</p>

<p>You wanted to know if I had taken any pictures. Unfortunately
all cameras were confiscated, so nothing doing
in that direction. As it is, there is very little scenery
of interest where we are. The country is fairly well
blasted and the tops of all the trees are gone; but you
can see such pictures in the Sunday supplements.</p>

<p>I do not know, of course, if the newspapers say that
we are being well fed or not, but we certainly do not feel
the effects of the U-boat war. While we were in the
rest camp we did not eat any too well, but now that we
are in a permanent camp everything is changed. How
does roast beef, tomatoes, brown gravy, butter, tea, jam
and apple dumplings sound? Of course the apple dumplings
were not hard to get, as we have the apples growing
in our camp. The flour, however, came from the
good old U. S. A.</p>

<p>For the last few days I have been swinging a heavy
pick and axe and playing chauffeur (with some other
fellows) on a handcar. Believe me, it is hard work pumping
one of those cars heavily loaded against a head wind
or on an up grade. However, the work is doing me
worlds of good. I am feeling fine and getting stronger
every day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>There is something doing on our front to-night. From
all the banging noise Tommy must be strafing Fritz good
and plenty.</p>

<p>We have had several issues of tobacco since we arrived
in this part of the world. I do not know where the tobacco
comes from, but imagine it is part of the money
collected from our good citizens in New York. The
only trouble is that it is English tobacco and not the good
old American kind.</p>

<p>It would surprise many of our curio seeking friends
to see what we do with those that we pick up. Our
poker is an old French bayonet, something that many a
person would put in a cabinet under lock and key.</p>

<p>On Leave.&mdash;Immediately after breakfast I started for
a very famous city some nine or ten miles from our
camp. I stopped in for a friend of mine, in one of the
other companies. We started to walk to town in hopes
of having a motor lorry (just plain motor truck in
America) overtake us, but we had covered some five miles
before we were overtaken by a horse-drawn wagon.</p>

<p>This particular city (censor forbids my giving name)
was never reached by the Huns except at long range bombardment.
One can hardly believe the amount of destruction
the Huns are capable of doing when they start
out on their career of hate.</p>

<p>In this town they seem to have centered their vengeance
on a most beautiful church and one of the fine
old cemeteries that France is noted for. The church
was not entirely demolished, but I think it is beyond repair.
As for the cemetery, many a poor Frenchman returned
to the surface before the Angel Gabriel had blown
his trumpet.</p>

<p>Just next to this old cemetery is a new one. Instead of
old tombstones and marble crypts, this plot is marked
with many small white wooden crosses. Here and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
one can find a more pretentious cross, indicating an officer.
One cannot realize the tug at the heartstrings until
one has seen the hand marks of "Kultur." The only
consolation, a brutal one, is that on the way to the town
are many graves with German names on the crosses.</p>

<p>But let's get cheerful and talk of the main object of
my trip, to get something to eat. The real fun of the
day came while we were eating. Fritz paid us a visit by
aeroplane and dropped a few visiting cards in the shape
of bombs. A couple of Tommies were eating in the
same room, and as they showed a great deal of <i>sang
froid</i> I was compelled to do the same. However, my
real fear was that I wouldn't be able to finish my eggs,
but would have to dive for a bomb-proof. Fortunately he
was driven away before much damage was done and I
finished my eggs in peace.</p>

<p>I forgot to tell you that our quarters are the most comfortable
we have had. We are in a hut which is built
like a tunnel. The outside is made of corrugated iron,
but the inside is lined with wood. There are fourteen
of us in my hut, but there is plenty of room. We sleep
on cots for the first time since we left Fort Totten.</p>


<h3>IV&mdash;STORY OF AN AMERICAN WITH A
SIEGE BATTERY</h3>

<div class="center">(Told by Wallace Gibbs)</div>

<p><i>Our guide in this trench is with a British siege gun
battery shelling and being shelled by the Germans on the
Flanders front. He tells of a stormy night under shell
fire.</i></p>

<div class="right">
Aug. 13, 1917.
</div>

<p>Your letter followed me all around Blighty and over
half of France. And yet it got me. Got me in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
middle of a tree-shattered, shell-pocked country field, in
a wee hole in the ground. That's some postal service for
you!</p>

<p>Guns are going merrily to-night. Fritz was putting up
S. O. S. signals a bit ago. He dropped one on our cook
house about a quarter of an hour ago. Poor "Ginger,"
our cook, got it badly. Head, back and leg.</p>

<p>You can't dodge 'em here; there's too much row. Besides,
one don't hear the shell that's going to get one.
Don't know whether that's a blessing or not. A vivid
imagination is no good to any one out here. Some fellows
are jumpy with expectation; others are always smelling
gas, and so on.</p>

<p>Saw a boche plane brought down yesterday. He made
a terrific attempt to get right, almost succeeded, then nose
dived plumb!</p>

<p>Can you picture me in a little narrow, gravelike hole,
writing this&mdash;and guns firing behind me and Hun shrapnel
whining and bursting with a ping just outside? That's
the doings just now. Fritz is being real nasty.</p>

<p>You just live on chance at this game. One gets callous&mdash;only
thoughts of home annoy a bit. One fellow
got killed early this morning. It was hard lines. Fritz
was pushing the shell over; it was black and wet, only
gun flashes giving light now and again, leaving it blacker
than before. (Things are rotten in the night!) One
came very near to where they were unloading shell. He
made a dive for an old trench: just then another burst.
He copped it when he had only a yard to go. Another
second would have done it. It's all luck. I was at the
cook house to-night; I left just a bit before. I said to
a fellow, "Are you going up to the guns?" He said,
"No." So I pushed off on my own.</p>

<p>Still that's only stray shooting, nothing to what we
give Fritz. He must have hell in his lines. He's getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
what the British once got, only more so. He didn't have
to fight then, he merely walked over. Now he gets as
good as he gives, and he don't like it. You never saw
such a weary, scared-looking crowd in your natural as
the mob that came in from the latest push. I was sorry
for the boys&mdash;some looked only 15 years old. They
were mixed with big, sour, dour, square-head swine. We
are looking forward to giving them another dig soon.</p>

<p>The men are not commenting much on the U. S. A.
coming in. They don't comment much on anything, now
everybody is in; but it will make a big difference.</p>

<p>It's a very nice war in "Blighty," with nice time, polished
buttons and a pair of swanky boots and heaps of
glory reflected from the lads out here. But out here&mdash;well,
a fellow might fight a Hun, but damned if he can
fight a shell!</p>

<p>Still, it's marvelous how little notice one can take of
them when they're somewhere else, but it don't half
buck up one's ideas when they get personal. The soulful
Huns usually open up at night time when fellows are
trying to forget&mdash;shells and guns, lice and biscuits. (Oh,
those army biscuits!)</p>

<p>Well, George, this has got to finish. Gas is coming
over now in shells, dozens of them; I must put on my
mask. The air is growing sweet and sickly. Isn't he a
rotter?... All clear again. Jove, he dropped them
close! Some experience between those two lines, eh?
Hope this finds you in the Pink. Best regards to everybody.</p>


<h3>V&mdash;STORY OF AN AMERICAN AMBULANCE
DRIVER AT BATTLEFRONT</h3>

<div class="center">(Told by James M. White&mdash;"Somewhere in France")</div>

<p><i>The thrilling experiences through which drivers for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
American Ambulance in France pass are narrated in this
letter. Mr. White has been decorated with the Croix de
Guerre.</i></p>

<p>So many things have happened ... that I hardly
know where to begin. Also, I am pretty tired out, so
please excuse this letter if it is rather incoherent. We
have been working our present posts now for three weeks
and often it has meant forty-eight hours steady. Not
only has it been hard work but it has been most exciting.
One of the boys who has been always with the section
says that never has he seen such all round hard and exciting
work. It is practically over now and we will all
be very glad to go <i>en repos</i>.</p>

<p>You have seen by the papers of around this date what
a successful attack the French have made. Out of the
numerous sections of the ambulance we had the honor of
doing the hardest work, and it has been well appreciated,
for letters have been written to the General about it.
That probably will mean a citation for us.</p>

<p>When I write you about what we have gone through
I do it, not for personal reasons, but because I want you
to know that this work is no play, and far from being an
occupation of the "semi-heroic rich." I have seen more
of war in five minutes in this sector than in months in
the other places we have been. Nine of our twelve cars
have been hit, but luckily only one chap has been
wounded, and that not very seriously. I really think
there is a divine Providence watching over us, for you
would hardly believe some miraculous escapes that have
taken place.</p>

<p>I have seen demonstrated something which I had heard
but never believed, namely that a shell can land so close
that its proximity saves one, the eclats going over one's
head. Shells play queer tricks at times. Three cars
were standing in a row, one with two wounded. A shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
landed near and the concussion blew whole panels out
of each car and killed the two men. The remarkable part
is that neither the cars nor men were actually hit by
anything but dirt.</p>

<p>Nowadays the Germans seldom send over waves of
gas. They seem to prefer to send in hundreds of gas
shells. These have the same whistle as the high explosives
but do not explode with a loud noise. It is more
like the opening of a gigantic ginger ale bottle. They
do a lot of damage, for they often catch one unawares.
They will pick out a hollow and just drench it with gas
shells; some smell like garlic and others like mustard.
We have found it impossible to drive at night with masks
on, especially those of us who wear glasses, for they immediately
fog up. All of us dread these shells, much
preferring to take our chance with the high explosive.
A soldier was telling me of a new gas that they send in
by shells. Wherever there is a perspiration on the body
it forms an acid which gives a very bad burn. The men
suffer most around the necks, under the arms and on the
hands.</p>

<p>Altogether, this has been a tremendously interesting
period. The aerial activity has been intense, there being
lots of fights and numerous captive balloons brought
down. The Germans have a nasty habit of coming over
at night, flying low and turning their mitrailleuse on the
roads which they know are crowded with wagons carrying
material.</p>

<p>By a lucky shot the other day the Germans started a
fire in a small munitions depot quite close to us. I have
seen displays of fireworks, but this had them all beaten
with a four hours' display. Some of the abris up front
are perfect marvels of safety and comfort and I shall
try and give you an idea of one. One side of a solid
stone hill had been used before the war as a quarry. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
particular side happened to be away from the Boche. It
has been so tunnelled that one walks through cave after
cave with plenty of head room and spacious rooms.
Everywhere there is plenty of light supplied by an electric
generator and one finds a wonderfully complete and
clean operating room. Remember this is all within a
mile and a half of the front-line trenches, which in modern
warfare is a short distance.</p>

<p>The wounded get splendid treatment; but of course
stretchers take the place of beds, for it is by no means a
hospital. They can comfortably take care of 200 men
and, mind you, all of this has been cut out of solid rock.
At such a post we get the men and take them back to
the field hospital, where they may again be sorted for
transport to the hospitals further back.</p>

<p>We carried quite a few German wounded yesterday
and it is very interesting to hear their ideas about things
in general. Most of them seem to be in great perplexity
about why we declared war. Some of them seem like
mere boys and others quite old, but then that holds for
all armies.</p>

<p>It is almost a month since I heard from America, but
then I know how busy you all must be with the moving.
Please tell Tom that the second package of tobacco has
come and I am ever so grateful. I lost my passport but
have another. I had to have new pictures taken and
walked all over Paris on a hot day to find a place, hence
the expression.</p>


<h3>VI&mdash;STORY OF HOW PERSHING SAW THE
GERMANS ATTACK</h3>

<div class="center">(Told by J. Welling Lane, with American Ambulance)</div>

<p><i>The writer of this letter, J. Welling Lane, left his
place with the banking firm of Montgomery, Clothier &amp;</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
<i>Tyler, 14 Wall street, New York, in April, 1917, to go to
France with the American Ambulance. He had served
on the Mexican border with the First Field Artillery.</i></p>

<div class="right">
France, Aug. 23, 1917.<br />
</div>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear</span> &mdash;&mdash;:<br />
</p>

<p>Well, old man, I can certainly tell of some real experiences
now. The latest: Last night we had an air
raid, beginning around 9 o'clock, when the Boche came
over and dropped some bombs, trying for some gun positions
near here, then at exactly 12:30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> a big raid.
There must have been at least five machines or more
came flying very low and dropped a bomb within twelve
feet of our barracks, wounding one of the boys who slept
in the corner nearest the bomb in the bottom of his heel.
He will be all right soon, but will take quite some time
to recover.</p>

<p>It is a wonder to all he did not get it anywhere else.
I drove him to the hospital with our Lieutenant and
waited until they extracted the eclat, and am keeping it
for him. It went through the wooden wall, through the
blankets and carried a piece of blanket into the wound.
Then another of the fellows lying opposite received a hard
scratch, but only a scalp wound.</p>

<p>Our Brigadier, or Quartermaster, who keeps tires, etc.,
was sleeping in a little shed within seven feet of the hit,
and when we all rushed over we heard him groaning,
and I broke in the door to find him on the floor. He was
hit in three places, a long piece in his side and one little
piece piercing his backbone. He is dead now. Our barracks
is riddled with holes from the eclat. The hole is
about three feet deep and very narrow, the eclat spreading
in all directions. There were all told eight bombs
dropped around us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<div class="right">
Sept. 26, 1917.
</div>

<p>One did not explode and can be seen in the ground
near a stable. If it had exploded it would have no doubt
killed many horses. That was a pretty close call for
all of us, no doubt being brought on by the new gun
position. One of the guns, by the way, was the one that
silenced the German gun that used to shell Dunkirk,
being able to shell twenty to twenty-five miles.</p>

<p>We just gave them a most successful attack when
every objective was gained besides 6,000 to 7,000 prisoners&mdash;174
officers were taken. We assisted Section 18
of the American Ambulance and I worked from 11
o'clock Sunday to Wednesday at 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and during
that time had only about seven hours sleep. But strange
as it may seem, no doubt, the excitement and all, I did
not feel sleepy or tired but as fresh as if I never had
worked. We secured our meals after a fashion, often
times missing some.</p>

<p>The wonderful part is the few wounded other than
very slight wounds upon the French side. The Boche
said the artillery work was awful. One English speaking
person said he had no food for three days and of a
battalion of 1,000 men only twenty-one were left. The
food they are getting is very poor and very little and
every one was tickled to death to be a prisoner.</p>

<p>Some of the strangest sights were the Germans working
as brancardiers helping to carry the wounded. One
instance which I photographed was a Boche coming
down the road helping a wounded Frenchman. Another
was five prisoners coming down from the post of secours
that we moved up to as soon as the position had advanced,
which before was on the three line trenches, came
down the road without any guard at all. They just told
them to walk to the next village. It is all so wonderful;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
never have I been so close or in such an interesting
place.</p>

<p>From our post secours, which by the way has been
advanced again to the spot which before the attack was
no man's land&mdash;you can see all the French lines being on
the side hill, the Boche positions being on top. Now
advanced about four kilometres. This attack we have
been through makes up for the long repose we have
had. Our division was not in the attack, only one regiment,
and we only assisted Section 18, but they are a
white livered bunch and our section did duty continually
while they sat around telling their weird tales of gas and
having to work so long without sleep, &amp;c. Far from the
spirit all section four has, who were fighting all the time
for more work. All the time grumbling did not have
enough.</p>

<p>One man who is dying now I heard is to get the
Medaille Militaire, the very highest honor the army has,
and is only bestowed upon the men when there is no
chance for them. Some section we have, haven't we?
Now another of our boys will receive the Croix de
Guerre medal. He came down one portion of the road
usually shelled with three couchés and one assis on the
seat beside him. As he came down they were dropping
them in. The boys were tiring and replacing the cars in
between the shots, which came at 2&frac12; minute intervals,
and one broke near him, wounding the assis beside him.</p>

<p>A piece of eclat caught our man in the arm, making a
slight flesh wound and leaving a piece of wood in it. It
had passed through a part of the body of the car and
blew this wood into him. He had enough gas in the
feed pipe to carry him about a hundred feet outside of
the zone when another of our section cars came along
and took his assis, who by now was a couché down for a
dressing. Our man stopped a carrier and had them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
take his blessés back to the post while he tried to start
his car, but was unsuccessful. He ran down a trench
through the falling shells from another post of secours
with a note to our post telling that everything was O. K.,
and the wounded taken care of. They took him to the
hospital, and he is now back with us, but not in service
for a while. He is to get a medal.</p>

<p>We are certainly being hammered up a bit, but think
the worst is over, so there is absolutely no need to worry
about me, as I haven't come near anything yet. Pershing
and Pétain were down the road while the attack was
on, and also our post was visited by a Regular American
Army Medical Colonel while we were in action. It is
now all over and the service is to be taken over by the
American Army. I don't know what difference it will
make with us. Since last night's fracas we are to have a
guard posted all night to warn us of any more raids so
we can get into our trench, which is more than safe
against any repetition.</p>

<p>An English speaking boche gave me a photo postal
card of himself and mate and gave the date and
place and signed his name. I have a boche gas mask
and many buttons and shoulder-straps. The boches
do not recognize hospitals plainly marked with red
cross, since they threw bombs on a nearby hospital, burning
up four buildings, killing 170 and wounding forty-one.
'Tis one of the hospitals we evacuated too, but now
is being evacuated by a French section. A British section
of the best which has been in this section with the
French army two years and has been twice cited in army
orders was hit and one couché killed and four were
wounded and the driver only a slight flesh wound during
the attack. Strange to say, so many ambulances always
come clear. Their speed helps. Good luck to you all.</p>
